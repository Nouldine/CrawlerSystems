Uses writing in many forms and genres to help students explore how race, gender, and sexuality intersect with language and inform textual experiences. From marriage licenses, passports, and don't ask, don't tell policies to literacy requirements and gag rules, written texts have played major roles in enforcing expectations about race and sex in the United States. At the same time, anti-slavery petitions, letters to the editor, wheat-pasted posters, and hashtag activism all also harness the power of writing to challenge and revise those expectations. In light of that active textual production and negotiation, this class traces public debates and daily experiences where people write or talk about race and sex in order to make a difference. Ultimately, the class takes on the power of words to break bones and heal wounds. Through reading and writing informed by scholarship in writing studies and rhetoric, students in this class will examine historical and contemporary interconnections among race, sexuality, gender, and texts in the United States, developing analytical tools for understanding how language works on and in their world.

Words and rules of combination (grammar) are the two basic building blocks of language. Looks at English words from different linguistic perspectives: As objects of grammar, words follow certain rules of combination (you wouldn't say ""these dog ), but they also have internal structure. For example, a word like ""hopefulness is fine, while ""hopenessful"" does not exist. From a psycholinguistic perspective examine how children learn these formal properties as well as the meaning of words. Study how words are stored in the mind and what one can learn from situations in which one cannot access the mental dictionary properly (for example, when one feels a word is on ""the tip of one's tongue ). From a sociolinguistic perspective,  look at historical and current influences on English vocabulary, including the role of dictionaries and spelling as a source of standardization.

Explores how a humanistic perspective can broaden our understanding of health and medicine.

This course is intended to help students understand World War II from the perspective of Asia. The focus is not only on the American and Japanese roles in the war but also on lesser, often overlooked participants such as China, Korea, and Southeast Asia. The course will focus not only on the diplomatic, political, and military situation of wartime Asia, but also on perceptions and experiences of the war from those most heavily affected by it: those experiencing it on the ground. Understanding this war is critical for helping us understand contemporary Asia. The foundations of the Cold War and the post-Cold War world that we live in today were forged on battlefields in mainland China, Burma, small islands in the Pacific, and in the skies over the archipelago of Japan. In order to provide the background and understand the legacies, this course covers an extended time frame, beginning in the 19th century with the arrival of the West in Asia and continues into the 1950s.

This course provides students with continued advancement in reflective practices through discussion of cases, infant and family observations and mindfulness experiences as applied to their work with infants, young children and families. Students are provided with additional practice strategies and increasingly in-depth opportunities for introspection self-awareness and supportive discussion towards greater, clarity and engagement in their work. This will include a greater recognition of the parallel process between the nature of their relationship with a parent and the parent's relationship with their child.. The focus will be on the application of mindfulness strategies and reflective practices to relationship-based therapeutic interventions with families of infants and young children, with a special focus on underserved populations and family circumstances where maternal depression, other mental health and co-morbid substance abuse disorders or trauma experiences (current or past) may contribute to disturbances in the parent-child relationship and the child's development. The course will also introduce mindfulness strategies that can be offered to parents and young children to reduce stress and increase mindful awareness and attention. In addition, concepts of ethics and boundaries will be integrated into the seminar course throughout the semester. There will also be opportunities for students to reflect upon their experiences in planning and conducting outreach education and consultation on topics related to infant, early childhood and family mental health to programs within their communities. The implications for policy and practice will also be addressed. This course will also include a self-assessment process that will support the students in assessing the appropriate level of endorsement and their readiness to apply for the Wisconsin Alliance for Infant Mental Health Endorsement. The semester concludes with an all-day mindfulness retreat incorporating what was learned over the semester.

This course will deepen our understanding of how health is produced over the life course. A life course approach focuses on how early life experiences influence health across lives and possibly generations. This includes the concept of ""linked lives"" or how health is produced in the context of familial and social relationships. Using a life course and human development framework, we will explore a number of concepts explaining how exposures in early life lead to health outcomes at later life stages. Namely, we will examine critical or sensitive periods (i.e., ""Barker hypothesis"" or ""fetal or biological programming""), cumulative effects, pathways and trajectories, risk and resilience, and  intergenerational impacts (transmission of health across one or more  generations). Through this lens, we will consider the biobehavioral processes that underlie the development of health across the life course. Together this  theoretical and empirical evidence will be applied to the understanding of the evolution and persistence of health disparities. Data sources, study designs,  and statistical approaches used in life course epidemiology and family health services research will also be reviewed and evaluated. Finally, we will explore implications for clinical and public health practice, policy, and health system development with an eye towards the development of effective and sustainable life course interventions. We will conclude the course with an in-depth examination of three case-studies that will allow the students to apply their knowledge to specific life course and family health services research examples. The purpose of this course is to provide students with a foundation for understanding: 1) the terminology and theoretical framework used in life  course epidemiology and family health services research; 2) biobehavioral pathways by which early life experiences impact health across the life course; 3) the data sources, study designs, and statistical approaches used in life course epidemiology and family health services research; 4) the implications for clinical and public health practice, policy, and health system development with an eye towards the development of effective and sustainable life course interventions.

Skepticism and conspiracism can be barriers to successful implementation of public health and medical interventions such as vaccination, fluoridation of water, and HIV treatment. Conversations between people with opposing viewpoints, whether face-to- face or via social media, often devolve to disparagement and dismissal. Awareness of or experience with such exchanges causes us to avoid tackling such ""hot button"" topics with friends, colleagues, and members of our communities. While it is all too easy to believe people who adopt conspiracy theories to be members of the fringe, research has shown that medical conspiracy theories are widely known, broadly endorsed, and highly predictive of many common health behaviors.

The public policy process is structured argument and decision making within institutional contexts. This class introduces students to analytic frameworks for thinking about various aspects of this process. We do not study a single context or policy, but, rather, seek to understand how policies might succeed (or fail) in one context or another. The principal framework is institutional analysis, or the way in which formal and informal rules shape policies and their outcomes. Students will learn to perform institutional analysis as well as write a memorandum presenting such an analysis to a policymaker. Students will align their final projects to their personal and professional activities and/or their internship. The course will help students understand how policies can achieve durable impact, and how progress made through policies can be defended amid institutional pitfalls. Enroll Info: None,

How powerful is non-military power? What are its vectors and its limits? International relations theorists have defined soft power as ""the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion."" This graduate seminar will put this notion to the test. We will investigate how elites, interest groups, religious bodies, and nation-states seek to exercise hegemony in the international order through non-violent means. How was ""soft power"" implemented on the ground in the 20th century- and how did its use transform international relations? To probe these questions, we will focus on a series of case studies in European and U.S. international history. Topics covered include the expansion of capitalism and consumer culture; the globalization of international legal instruments and human rights claims; and de-secularization, religious radicalism, and counter-insurgency. In the process of analyzing our case studies, we will refine our analytical vocabulary. Drawing on recent work in international relations, political theory, and international history, we will probe the meaning and utility of concepts like normative power, hegemony, cultural capital, and public diplomacy.

This course is unique among the graduate curricula, introducing students to the pathogenesis of disease via integration of actual autopsy patient cases. Emphasis is placed on understanding the basic mechanisms of disease at the level of cell, organ, and body, as well as the morphologic expression patterns of selected common specific disease processes. In addition to attending twice-weekly lectures, students will participate in weekly autopsy gross organ conferences as well as microscopic review sessions. In this way, the concepts covered in lectures will be applied and reinforced in the interactive autopsy sessions. Students will also observe at least one full autopsy, gaining a three-dimensional understanding of structure and disease. The grade for this course is derived from a final multiple-choice exam and a short essay regarding an autopsy case. At the conclusion of this course, students should: gain an appreciation of how disease processes directly impact patients; be able to distinguish the morphologic patterns of normal versus pathologic tissues; be familiar with the pathogenesis of selected common disease processes; and recognize how basic laboratory research may be applied to specific disease processes.

This course offers a comprehensive overview of clinical laboratory testing in the fields of medical genetics and public health. Topics include how genetic testing is integrated into patient care, including prenatal genetics, newborn screening, genetic testing in children and adults, and oncology genetics. Students will develop a strong foundational knowledge of basic genetics principles, identify indications for genetic testing, interpret population screening results and the implications for public health, assess the utility of diagnostic testing, and recognize the limitations of genetic testing and clinical laboratory medicine. It is anticipated that students will incorporate these concepts, knowledge, experiences, and evidence in their future clinical practice. Enroll Info: None,

The surgeon-pathologist relationship is an integral aspect of the surgical care process. The intraoperative and postoperative findings of the pathologist confirm that the appropriate course of action was taken, and this information determines what the surgeon will tell the patient and his or her family about the disease entity, prognosis, and recommended next steps. In this basic science selective, future surgeons will have the opportunity to refresh their understanding of essential anatomy and histology, and deepen their knowledge of disease pathophysiology. They will also engage in multiple practical learning activities such as cutting a frozen section, working up a transfusion reaction, staining and interpreting an FNA cytology slide, assisting in prosecting (grossing) surgical pathology and autopsy specimens and following up on the diagnosis/molecular testing/tumor board discussion to enhance their understanding of the pathologist¿s critical role in managing surgical patients.
