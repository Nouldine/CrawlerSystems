Indigenous peoples often have very close relationships to ancestral homelands, species and natural resources. However, definitions of ""indigenous"" can be controversial and highly politicized. Diverse outlooks on identities, worldviews and environmental governance clarify the complex meanings of indigeneity in the US. This course highlights Native American perspectives, conservation practices, and policy environments through consideration of US and international case studies. Native American experiences shed light on pressing issues of resource sustainability and sovereignty, and demonstrate linkages to global Indigenous environmental issues and strategies.

Can HipHop culture help produce a more just world? If so, what theory and praxis best advance this aim? These are the questions that drive this conceptual course. Our critical interrogation of the relationship between HipHop and social justice considers the culture from its U.S. Black Power era underpinnings to its disparate contemporary ""glocal"" manifestations. We begin by asking what is ""HipHop,"" what is ""social justice,"" and what is their relationship, and proceed to consider how HipHop can be an effective force for social justice and what obstacles mitigate against this potential. These discussions will develop familiarity with important concepts in Black studies and social theory such as race and colonialism, imperialism and hegemony, structure and agency, identity and strategic essentialism. Weekly readings will typically pair writings specifically on HipHop with theory from across the humanities and social sciences including philosophy, sociology, cultural studies, and political economy. We will endeavor to consider the race/class/gender dimensions of our weekly topics. Students will acquire a broader familiarity with HipHop activism, and develop new conceptual tools and critical thinking skills. Enroll Info: None",3 credits.,

An extensive overview of the literature during Japan's early modern or Edo period (1600-1868). The main goal of the course is to introduce one of the world's great cultures through its literature during a period that many people consider to be the culmination of a millennium of cultural development prior to Japan's forced opening to the West in the second half of the nineteenth century. To this end we will read snippets from vastly popular works in the major genres of comic books, novellas, essays, poetry, kabuki and puppet plays and so on, concentrating on the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Some key questions in this course include: What is early modernity? What is literature? What is Japanese about these materials?

Examines the arts and cultures of Europe and the Mediterranean basin before the Renaissance. We explore canonical works such as the pyramids at Giza, the Parthenon in Athens, the Venus di Milo, Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, the Book of Kells, the Great Mosque at Córdoba, Chartres cathedral, and Giotto's Arena Chapel. But we also define art broadly, to encompass the material culture of everyday life, including jewelry, ceramics, and textiles. We consider the social and historical contexts of art and artistic production - art and imperialism, ethnicity, technology, religious ritual and belief, and myth and storytelling. These explorations address basic human concerns: death and the afterlife, desire and the body, self-definition and portraiture, power and propaganda, monstrosity and the supernatural, the divine and the sacred. We develop crucial skill sets: critical visual analysis, contextual interpretation, research methods and resources, historiography, and oral, written and digital communication.

Our discussions will explore important masterpieces by such renowned artists as Leonardo da Vinci, Rembrandt van Rijn, Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne, Pablo Picasso, Frida Kahlo, and Frank Lloyd Wright alongside other works of fine art, architecture, the decorative arts, and photography. By studying the political, historical, social and cultural contexts of their making, we will begin to understand how certain works of art were valued from the moment of their making, fought over by different nations, bought, sold, stolen, or ignored for centuries and revived only recently for study. We will critically examine the concept of artistic genius; the influence of colonialism and imperialism on artistic production and consumption; the role of the patron and the art market in art's production and circulation; the relationship of fine art and popular culture; and the idea of globalization as it relates to ""western"" artistic traditions. Students will develop skills in visual analysis that can help them understand artistic production over the past 500 years as well as succeed in today's visually oriented culture. They will also learn about dominant interpretive approaches and research tools in art history that have applicability across the humanities as well as digital applications that will help them create online exhibitions.

ART IS GLOBAL (and always has been). Today, we find Egyptian protest artists inspiring activists around the globe via the internet, but in earlier times, Roman glass and Buddhist icons moved along the ancient Silk Route, networks of exchange flourished in the medieval Mediterranean region, and colonial empires brought visual cultures into volatile contact. This course teaches students how to analyze images and objects produced through such exchanges that occurred around the world from ancient times through the contemporary. Its aims are to develop skills needed to live fully in a world in which borders are no barriers to the movement of images, objects, and ideas and to deepen understanding of cultural differences and interactions. By exploring works in a range of media and tracing processes of cross-cultural exchange, the course also develops sensitivity to visual and material form and a solid foundation in the practice of visual and material analysis.

This course considers the end of Modernist art as it gives way to what is called, problematically, contemporary art. While the term modern may generally mean what is vanguard or current, Modernism indicates a period of art (and the humanities) ranging from, arguably, 1880-1950. By considering its end, one can study four pivotal aspects of the movement: its origins, themes, and afterlives, as well as the art and histories that challenge its coherence. In this thematic survey, then, Modernism will emerge as a heterogeneous set of images and attendant discourses which, negatively or positively, continue to work within the contemporary artistic and cultural moment.

Over the course of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, painting in the Netherlands experienced dramatic technological advancements: the application of oil on panel allowed for an unprecedented richness of color; experiments with optics led to improved illusions of space; artists rendered light and reflections as never before. Did these advancements in depicting the natural world conflict with or enhance the portrayal of spiritual visions? Did realism pave the way for secular art? In this course, we will look critically at the relationship of science and art, tradition and innovation, the imagined and the experienced. The delicate preciousness of Jan van Eyck, the strange spaces of Petrus Christus, the bizarre hellscapes of Hieronymus Bosch, and the peasant festivals of Peter Bruegel will guide us through these themes.

This course critically reexamines concepts traditionally associated with the Renaissance by focusing on the exchange of artistic ideas throughout the Holy Roman Empire and across different media, such as altarpiece paintings, carved portraits, stained glass narratives, innovative uses of print, reappropriations of metalwork, and expressive uses of drawing. The course is organized thematically around four topics: religious art as piety and politics; antiquity as a source of tradition and imagination; the formulation of a public discourse that exposed social threats; and the distinctiveness of artistic claims of individual achievement. A motif throughout the course is the question of how the survival of fragments may be presented in museum contexts as parts standing in for an absent whole. Special topics address collecting, conservation, and technical research. We will also consider how historians approach designs for works of art now lost or never completed. Assignments focus on objects from the Chazen Museum and the Special Collections of Memorial Library. Enroll Info: Sophomore standing",3 credits., — PROSEMINAR IN JAPANESE ART

This course examines the history of American Art from the period of permanent European settlement through the present. Works of art and other forms of material culture will be explored and discussed within the context of philosophical, historical, social, and cultural developments in the United States and across the globe. In this course, works of art and artifacts are interpreted not as passive objects that reflect history, but rather as active agents that are entwined with broader historical, social, and cultural events. A particular focus will be on the ways in which American art and material culture participates in the construction of identities - ranging from global identities and national identities (in particular, how notions of ""American"" have been constructed) to regional, group and individual identities. Although the course will mainly cover works of painting, sculpture, and architecture, other forms of material culture, especially photography, decorative arts and popular illustrations, will also be considered. Attention will also be given to the writings of artists and critics, as well as texts by contemporary art historians, historians, and other scholars that illustrate the variety of methods that are currently being brought to bear on the interpretation of American art, architecture, and material culture. Students will learn skills that will help them construct histories of American art and material culture in written narratives (papers) as well as in online exhibitions through a series of short research exercises. Outside of examinations, assignments will be tied to works of art on display at the Chazen Museum of Art or other local collections. Enroll Info: ",3 credits., — INTRODUCTION TO MUSEUM STUDIES I

Traces out some of the radical changes in art produced after roughly 1950, or what might be called contemporary art. By using the term contemporary, however, we also refer to a certain broadly defined set of ideas that inform and emerge from this highly diverse production. The course will largely (although not exclusively) focus on American and European art after the ""decline"" of Modernism. That entails familiarizing the class with movements ranging from color field painting, to postmodern production, to performance, video, and installation. Additionally, attention will be paid to artists and artwork that are not adequately represented by the traditional categories of art history.

The tenth century CE marked a period of drastic change in the Islamic world, as the unified Islamic caliphate splintered into three rival dynasties: the Sunni Iraqi Abbasids, Spanish Umayyads, and the Shi'ite Fatimids in Egypt. In their quest to dominate the Islamic world and control the Mediterranean, each dynasty openly competed and responded to the others in architectural projects, ceremonial practices and courtly arts. At the same time, the monolithic model of courtly patronage of the arts was replaced gradually by one in which the urban classes increasingly shaped the art market, resulting in new visual forms. This course considers this turning point in the history of Islamic culture through the lens of art and architectural patronage. By exploring the architectural and urban projects of the three dynasties, we will examine competing visions of power, sources of legitimacy and the development of Cairo, Samarra and Cordoba as capital cities. We will also consider the role of portable arts, addressing the role of exchange and gift-giving in the Mediterranean context and the problems of attribution in this highly mobile environment. Course themes include the role of sectarian identity (Shi'ite vs Sunni); the incorporation of Christian and Jewish culture; the relation between the court and urban populations; and the meaning of ornament and style in Islamic art.

This course explores the history of places that have been called the American West since 1850. We start with incorporation, as the U.S. surveyed a West that had become American in name and tried to make it American in fact, a process that westerners resisted as often as they welcomed it. By the late 19th century, the West was an identifiable region with characteristic economic features, race relations, and federal ties, and it held a unique place in collective memory. In the 20th century, western distinctiveness faded in some ways and persisted in others, and western variants unfolded of the world wars, Depression, Cold War, and Vietnam War; civil rights; suburbanization and the New Right; environmentalism; immigration; and globalization. We employ economic, environmental, political, cultural, and social analyses, and attend to the dreams of many westerners: people of North American, Latin American, European, African, and Asian descent, and of all genders, classes, and sexualities.

Provides a critical examination of the history of labor and working people in the Americas, from the colonial era to the present. It focuses on the experience of the United States and Mexico, offering a comparative perspective on their distinct but also shared (and increasingly linked) histories. The seminar proceeds chronologically, highlighting major episodes in the evolution of labor systems in the two countries, beginning with the colonial labor systems implemented by the Spanish and British empires following the European conquest of the Western Hemisphere. Among other topics, we will examine the pivotal role of slavery and other forms of forced labor, the impact of the industrial revolution, the emergence and expansion of corporate capitalism and the labor unrest it provoked in the post-civil war U.S., the role of labor in the Mexican Revolution and its aftermath, the impact of the Great Depression and labor incorporation on the post-WWII social and political order of both countries, the breakdown of that order and the move to neo-liberalism in the 1970s and 1980s, and the emergence of an increasingly integrated North American production system and its consequences for labor and working people on both sides of the US-Mexico border.

Ancient monsters were forces of chaos that threatened the natural order of the universe: they had to be contained, banished to the edges of the world or destroyed. But the Greeks and Romans also believed them to be magical beings that held the promise of special knowledge - of the past, of dangers to be faced, of musical arts - or which, like the Sphinx, possessed an enigmatic intelligence capable of fooling all but the most cunning of mortals. In this course we investigate these contrasting aspects of ancient monsters, drawing directly on texts (in translation) and works of art through which the Greeks and Romans explored the monstrous and its place in their world. We also compare ancient representations with those in modern artistic media - comics, games, stories and movies - considering both how our notions of the monstrous are influenced by or contrast with those of our ancient predecessors, and how our very identities are created by and enacted through our depictions of monsters.

Focusing primarily on the world of the ancient Romans, this course (in translation) interrogates the phenomenon and notion of ""conspiracy"" within the political, social, and religious spheres. After investigating some of the more famous political conspiracies (e.g. the Catilinarian Conspiracy, assassination of Julius Caesar, etc.), we will then turn to the structure of the traditional Roman household, including the preeminence of the paterfamilias and the challenges that women, children, and/or slaves pose to his notional ""tyranny."" Finally, we will consider a number of prominent religions that came into conflict with Roman authorities - especially the mystery cults surrounding Bacchus as well as early Christianity. We will also have the opportunity to bring to bear the insights gleaned from the ancient world on the modern one in our consideration of such modern conspiracies as the Salem Witch Trials, the Red Scare of the '50s, the Kennedy Assassination, and the Watergate Conspiracy. As we shall see, ""conspiracy"" can be a tendentious concept that often reveals more about the society and culture in which it occurs (as well as the authors who write about it) than the actual activities it would seem to denote.

How can education - for children and adults, in school and out - help to address crucial environmental and social sustainability challenges? What ideas and strategies have guided environmental and sustainability education over the years? What can individual people do to address environmental challenges, and what can only be accomplished by people working together? What does sustainability have to do with justice - and vice versa? Examine the principles behind behavior change and empowerment, community action and whole-scale social reform. Drawing on research and theory from across the social sciences, we will explore the uncertain relationship between education and advocacy, seeking the means by which education can have the greatest impact without compromising the core ideals of a democratic society.

Sound plays a crucial but understudied role in experiences of media and cultural life. From the mundane sounds of our daily routines to the irresistible refrains of our favorite songs, sound (in its various guises as noise, music, echo, vibration, etc.) is fundamental to communications media and, more broadly, to our perceptions of the world around us. This class will introduce you to the emerging field of sound studies and encourage you to investigate the role sound and music (or lack thereof) play in various communications media. Through audio assignments such as the creation of podcasts, we will learn the basics of digital audio recording and editing software and how to present and distribute audio content via the Internet, specifically as podcasts. By the end of this class, you will have both practical skills for creating digital audio projects and a deeper appreciation for how paying attention to sound leads to unique understandings of history, culture, and media technologies.

In the wake of World War Two, European directors began making films that employed location shooting, ambiguity, psychological realism, and unfamiliar stylistic flourishes. Such films drew on literary modernism, experimenting with time shifting, extreme duration, subjectivity, and reflexivity. ""Art cinema,"" as it came to be called, is now the dominant storytelling mode of the contemporary film festival circuit and constitutes a robust alternative to mainstream genre cinema. This course explores art cinema from a variety of national and transnational contexts, analyzing its narratives, styles, and cultural contexts. It investigates the work of directors from the first generation of art cinema, including Michelangelo Antonioni, Robert Bresson, Ingmar Bergman, and Agnès Varda, and more recent work by Aki Kaurismäki, Abbas Kiarostami, Wong Kar-wai, and Claire Denis.

Traumatically injured patients require rapid evaluation to assess for life-threatening injuries. Point of care ultrasound is the practice of clinicians performing and interpreting focused real time ultrasound exams at the patient's bedside, then immediately applying ultrasound findings to guide clinical management or dangerous procedures. Students will learn skills necessary to perform point of care ultrasound, especially for the traumatically injured patients. We will use a multi-modal approach to highlight the clinical relevance and sonographic features of anatomical structures, review pertinent anatomy in the chest and abdomen, and then re-approach these structures by using ultrasound in trauma patients in the Emergency Department.

Help medical students develop awareness of the subtleties of self-presentation and communication that are necessary for the physician-patient relationship and other professional interactions. These relationships are based on the student's interpersonal behaviors as much as on the factual clinical information that he or she brings to the therapeutic transaction. Because medical schools often select for intellectual proficiency over other forms of intelligence, even medical students with premedical clinical and community experience have often not developed the people skills required for clinical excellence.Students will have the opportunity to develop these skills working closely with horses and handlers.
