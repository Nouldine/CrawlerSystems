Can HipHop culture help produce a more just world? If so, what theory and praxis best advance this aim? These are the questions that drive this conceptual course. Our critical interrogation of the relationship between HipHop and social justice considers the culture from its U.S. Black Power era underpinnings to its disparate contemporary ""glocal"" manifestations. We begin by asking what is ""HipHop,"" what is ""social justice,"" and what is their relationship, and proceed to consider how HipHop can be an effective force for social justice and what obstacles mitigate against this potential. These discussions will develop familiarity with important concepts in Black studies and social theory such as race and colonialism, imperialism and hegemony, structure and agency, identity and strategic essentialism. Weekly readings will typically pair writings specifically on HipHop with theory from across the humanities and social sciences including philosophy, sociology, cultural studies, and political economy. We will endeavor to consider the race/class/gender dimensions of our weekly topics. Students will acquire a broader familiarity with HipHop activism, and develop new conceptual tools and critical thinking skills. Enroll Info: None",8 credits., — THIRD SEMESTER ARABIC

Indigenous peoples often have very close relationships to ancestral homelands, species and natural resources. However, definitions of ""indigenous"" can be controversial and highly politicized. Diverse outlooks on identities, worldviews and environmental governance clarify the complex meanings of indigeneity in the US.

An extensive overview of the literature during Japan's early modern or Edo period (1600-1868). The main goal of the course is to introduce one of the world's great cultures through its literature during a period that many people consider to be the culmination of a millennium of cultural development prior to Japan's forced opening to the West in the second half of the nineteenth century. To this end we will read snippets from vastly popular works in the major genres of comic books, novellas, essays, poetry, kabuki and puppet plays and so on, concentrating on the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Some key questions in this course include: What is early modernity? What is literature? What is Japanese about these materials?

Examines the arts and cultures of Europe and the Mediterranean basin before the Renaissance. We explore canonical works such as the pyramids at Giza, the Parthenon in Athens, the Venus di Milo, Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, the Book of Kells, the Great Mosque at Córdoba, Chartres cathedral, and Giotto's Arena Chapel. But we also define art broadly, to encompass the material culture of everyday life, including jewelry, ceramics, and textiles. We consider the social and historical contexts of art and artistic production - art and imperialism, ethnicity, technology, religious ritual and belief, and myth and storytelling. These explorations address basic human concerns: death and the afterlife, desire and the body, self-definition and portraiture, power and propaganda, monstrosity and the supernatural, the divine and the sacred. We develop crucial skill sets: critical visual analysis, contextual interpretation, research methods and resources, historiography, and oral, written and digital communication. Students will apply these skills in assignments focused on works of art in the Chazen Museum. Enroll Info: None",3-4 credits., — INTRODUCTION TO VISUAL CULTURES

Examines the arts and cultures of Europe and North America from the Renaissance through the present. Our discussions will explore important masterpieces by such renowned artists as Leonardo da Vinci, Rembrandt van Rijn, Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne, Pablo Picasso, Frida Kahlo, and Frank Lloyd Wright alongside other works of fine art, architecture, the decorative arts, and photography. By studying the political, historical, social and cultural contexts of their making, we will begin to understand how certain works of art were valued from the moment of their making, fought over by different nations, bought, sold, stolen, or ignored for centuries and revived only recently for study. We will critically examine the concept of artistic genius; the influence of colonialism and imperialism on artistic production and consumption; the role of the patron and the art market in art's production and circulation; the relationship of fine art and popular culture; and the idea of globalization as it relates to ""western"" artistic traditions. Students will develop skills in visual analysis that can help them understand artistic production over the past 500 years as well as succeed in today's visually oriented culture. They will also learn about dominant interpretive approaches and research tools in art history that have applicability across the humanities as well as digital applications that will help them create online exhibitions. Many assignments will focus on works of art in the Chazen Museum of Art. Enroll Info: None",3 credits., — SURVEY OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 1839 TO 1989

ART IS GLOBAL (and always has been). Today, we find Egyptian protest artists inspiring activists around the globe via the internet, but in earlier times, Roman glass and Buddhist icons moved along the ancient Silk Route, networks of exchange flourished in the medieval Mediterranean region, and colonial empires brought visual cultures into volatile contact. This course teaches students how to analyze images and objects produced through such exchanges that occurred around the world from ancient times through the contemporary. Its aims are to develop skills needed to live fully in a world in which borders are no barriers to the movement of images, objects, and ideas and to deepen understanding of cultural differences and interactions. By exploring works in a range of media and tracing processes of cross-cultural exchange, the course also develops sensitivity to visual and material form and a solid foundation in the practice of visual and material analysis.

This course considers the end of Modernist art as it gives way to what is called, problematically, contemporary art. While the term modern may generally mean what is vanguard or current, Modernism indicates a period of art (and the humanities) ranging from, arguably, 1880-1950. By considering its end, one can study four pivotal aspects of the movement: its origins, themes, and afterlives, as well as the art and histories that challenge its coherence. In this thematic survey, then, Modernism will emerge as a heterogeneous set of images and attendant discourses which, negatively or positively, continue to work within the contemporary artistic and cultural moment.

Over the course of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, painting in the Netherlands experienced dramatic technological advancements: the application of oil on panel allowed for an unprecedented richness of color; experiments with optics led to improved illusions of space; artists rendered light and reflections as never before. Did these advancements in depicting the natural world conflict with or enhance the portrayal of spiritual visions? Did realism pave the way for secular art? In this course, we will look critically at the relationship of science and art, tradition and innovation, the imagined and the experienced. The delicate preciousness of Jan van Eyck, the strange spaces of Petrus Christus, the bizarre hellscapes of Hieronymus Bosch, and the peasant festivals of Peter Bruegel will guide us through these themes.

This course critically reexamines concepts traditionally associated with the Renaissance by focusing on the exchange of artistic ideas throughout the Holy Roman Empire and across different media, such as altarpiece paintings, carved portraits, stained glass narratives, innovative uses of print, reappropriations of metalwork, and expressive uses of drawing. The course is organized thematically around four topics: religious art as piety and politics; antiquity as a source of tradition and imagination; the formulation of a public discourse that exposed social threats; and the distinctiveness of artistic claims of individual achievement. A motif throughout the course is the question of how the survival of fragments may be presented in museum contexts as parts standing in for an absent whole. Special topics address collecting, conservation, and technical research. We will also consider how historians approach designs for works of art now lost or never completed.

This course examines the history of American Art from the period of permanent European settlement through the present. Works of art and other forms of material culture will be explored and discussed within the context of philosophical, historical, social, and cultural developments in the United States and across the globe. In this course, works of art and artifacts are interpreted not as passive objects that reflect history, but rather as active agents that are entwined with broader historical, social, and cultural events. A particular focus will be on the ways in which American art and material culture participates in the construction of identities - ranging from global identities and national identities (in particular, how notions of ""American"" have been constructed) to regional, group and individual identities. Although the course will mainly cover works of painting, sculpture, and architecture, other forms of material culture, especially photography, decorative arts and popular illustrations, will also be considered. Attention will also be given to the writings of artists and critics, as well as texts by contemporary art historians, historians, and other scholars that illustrate the variety of methods that are currently being brought to bear on the interpretation of American art, architecture, and material culture. Students will learn skills that will help them construct histories of American art and material culture in written narratives (papers) as well as in online exhibitions through a series of short research exercises. Outside of examinations, assignments will be tied to works of art on display at the Chazen Museum of Art or other local collections. Enroll Info: ",3 credits., — INTRODUCTION TO MUSEUM STUDIES I

Traces out some of the radical changes in art produced after roughly 1950, or what might be called contemporary art. By using the term contemporary, however, we also refer to a certain broadly defined set of ideas that inform and emerge from this highly diverse production. The course will largely (although not exclusively) focus on American and European art after the ""decline"" of Modernism. That entails familiarizing the class with movements ranging from color field painting, to postmodern production, to performance, video, and installation. Additionally, attention will be paid to artists and artwork that are not adequately represented by the traditional categories of art history.

The tenth century CE marked a period of drastic change in the Islamic world, as the unified Islamic caliphate splintered into three rival dynasties: the Sunni Iraqi Abbasids, Spanish Umayyads, and the Shi'ite Fatimids in Egypt. In their quest to dominate the Islamic world and control the Mediterranean, each dynasty openly competed and responded to the others in architectural projects, ceremonial practices and courtly arts. At the same time, the monolithic model of courtly patronage of the arts was replaced gradually by one in which the urban classes increasingly shaped the art market, resulting in new visual forms. This course considers this turning point in the history of Islamic culture through the lens of art and architectural patronage. By exploring the architectural and urban projects of the three dynasties, we will examine competing visions of power, sources of legitimacy and the development of Cairo, Samarra and Cordoba as capital cities. We will also consider the role of portable arts, addressing the role of exchange and gift-giving in the Mediterranean context and the problems of attribution in this highly mobile environment. Course themes include the role of sectarian identity (Shi'ite vs Sunni); the incorporation of Christian and Jewish culture; the relation between the court and urban populations; and the meaning of ornament and style in Islamic art.

This course explores the history of places that have been called the American West since 1850. We start with incorporation, as the U.S. surveyed a West that had become American in name and tried to make it American in fact, a process that westerners resisted as often as they welcomed it. By the late 19th century, the West was an identifiable region with characteristic economic features, race relations, and federal ties, and it held a unique place in collective memory. In the 20th century, western distinctiveness faded in some ways and persisted in others, and western variants unfolded of the world wars, Depression, Cold War, and Vietnam War; civil rights; suburbanization and the New Right; environmentalism; immigration; and globalization. We employ economic, environmental, political, cultural, and social analyses, and attend to the dreams of many westerners: people of North American, Latin American, European, African, and Asian descent, and of all genders, classes, and sexualities.

Provides a critical examination of the history of labor and working people in the Americas, from the colonial era to the present. It focuses on the experience of the United States and Mexico, offering a comparative perspective on their distinct but also shared (and increasingly linked) histories. The seminar proceeds chronologically, highlighting major episodes in the evolution of labor systems in the two countries, beginning with the colonial labor systems implemented by the Spanish and British empires following the European conquest of the Western Hemisphere. Among other topics, we will examine the pivotal role of slavery and other forms of forced labor, the impact of the industrial revolution, the emergence and expansion of corporate capitalism and the labor unrest it provoked in the post-civil war U.S., the role of labor in the Mexican Revolution and its aftermath, the impact of the Great Depression and labor incorporation on the post-WWII social and political order of both countries, the breakdown of that order and the move to neo-liberalism in the 1970s and 1980s, and the emergence of an increasingly integrated North American production system and its consequences for labor and working people on both sides of the US-Mexico border.

Ancient monsters were forces of chaos that threatened the natural order of the universe: they had to be contained, banished to the edges of the world or destroyed. But the Greeks and Romans also believed them to be magical beings that held the promise of special knowledge - of the past, of dangers to be faced, of musical arts - or which, like the Sphinx, possessed an enigmatic intelligence capable of fooling all but the most cunning of mortals. In this course we investigate these contrasting aspects of ancient monsters, drawing directly on texts (in translation) and works of art through which the Greeks and Romans explored the monstrous and its place in their world. We also compare ancient representations with those in modern artistic media - comics, games, stories and movies - considering both how our notions of the monstrous are influenced by or contrast with those of our ancient predecessors, and how our very identities are created by and enacted through our depictions of monsters.

Focusing primarily on the world of the ancient Romans, this course (in translation) interrogates the phenomenon and notion of ""conspiracy"" within the political, social, and religious spheres. After investigating some of the more famous political conspiracies (e.g. the Catilinarian Conspiracy, assassination of Julius Caesar, etc.), we will then turn to the structure of the traditional Roman household, including the preeminence of the paterfamilias and the challenges that women, children, and/or slaves pose to his notional ""tyranny."" Finally, we will consider a number of prominent religions that came into conflict with Roman authorities - especially the mystery cults surrounding Bacchus as well as early Christianity. We will also have the opportunity to bring to bear the insights gleaned from the ancient world on the modern one in our consideration of such modern conspiracies as the Salem Witch Trials, the Red Scare of the '50s, the Kennedy Assassination, and the Watergate Conspiracy. As we shall see, ""conspiracy"" can be a tendentious concept that often reveals more about the society and culture in which it occurs (as well as the authors who write about it) than the actual activities it would seem to denote.

Sound plays a crucial but understudied role in experiences of media and cultural life. From the mundane sounds of our daily routines to the irresistible refrains of our favorite songs, sound (in its various guises as noise, music, echo, vibration, etc.) is fundamental to communications media and, more broadly, to our perceptions of the world around us. This class will introduce you to the emerging field of sound studies and encourage you to investigate the role sound and music (or lack thereof) play in various communications media. Through audio assignments such as the creation of podcasts, we will learn the basics of digital audio recording and editing software and how to present and distribute audio content via the Internet, specifically as podcasts. By the end of this class, you will have both practical skills for creating digital audio projects and a deeper appreciation for how paying attention to sound leads to unique understandings of history, culture, and media technologies.

In the wake of World War Two, European directors began making films that employed location shooting, ambiguity, psychological realism, and unfamiliar stylistic flourishes. Such films drew on literary modernism, experimenting with time shifting, extreme duration, subjectivity, and reflexivity. ""Art cinema,"" as it came to be called, is now the dominant storytelling mode of the contemporary film festival circuit and constitutes a robust alternative to mainstream genre cinema. This course explores art cinema from a variety of national and transnational contexts, analyzing its narratives, styles, and cultural contexts. It investigates the work of directors from the first generation of art cinema, including Michelangelo Antonioni, Robert Bresson, Ingmar Bergman, and Agnès Varda, and more recent work by Aki Kaurismäki, Abbas Kiarostami, Wong Kar-wai, and Claire Denis.

The purpose of this course is to explore the study of youth through theoretical, historical, social, and cultural perspectives. This class will interrogate the concept of ""youth"" as a socially constructed category and examine how ""youth"" have been positioned within educational, political, economic, and social contexts. Themes explored include: conceptions of youth as a social category, education and schooling, race, gender, sexuality, politics and activism, community-based learning, criminal justice, media and popular culture. By drawing on a variety of historical and contemporary ""texts"" and current events we will study the lived realities of youth who are situated within diverse racial, cultural, gendered, and classed contexts. Throughout the course, students will be able to reflect on their own experiences as 'youth,' their relationship to education and other social institutions - and how it informs their understanding of society, educational theory and practice.

Basic and Applied Insect Ecology is advanced course in population and community ecology, plant-insect interactions, insect biodiversity and biogeography, and applied ecology. The course will weave basic ecological theory and principles with their application to entomological problems such as conservation, biological control, agriculture, and insect-vectored diseases of plants and humans. We will use the current entomological and ecological scientific literature and draw on examples from a broad range of natural and managed ecosystems. As the semester progresses, the scope of the lectures and literature will broaden from pairwise species interactions (e.g., a predator and its prey) to the entire community of organisms and their physical environment. Lectures are designed to emphasize the theoretical principles and historical background underlying the various topics with a link to potential applications in agriculture, conservation, pest management, and/or invasion biology.

Uses writing in many forms and genres to help students explore how race, gender, and sexuality intersect with language and inform textual experiences. From marriage licenses, passports, and don't ask, don't tell policies to literacy requirements and gag rules, written texts have played major roles in enforcing expectations about race and sex in the United States. At the same time, anti-slavery petitions, letters to the editor, wheat-pasted posters, and hashtag activism all also harness the power of writing to challenge and revise those expectations. In light of that active textual production and negotiation, this class traces public debates and daily experiences where people write or talk about race and sex in order to make a difference. Ultimately, the class takes on the power of words to break bones and heal wounds. Through reading and writing informed by scholarship in writing studies and rhetoric, students in this class will examine historical and contemporary interconnections among race, sexuality, gender, and texts in the United States, developing analytical tools for understanding how language works on and in their world.

Words and rules of combination (grammar) are the two basic building blocks of language. Looks at English words from different linguistic perspectives: As objects of grammar, words follow certain rules of combination (you wouldn't say ""these dog ), but they also have internal structure. For example, a word like ""hopefulness is fine, while ""hopenessful"" does not exist. From a psycholinguistic perspective examine how children learn these formal properties as well as the meaning of words. Study how words are stored in the mind and what one can learn from situations in which one cannot access the mental dictionary properly (for example, when one feels a word is on ""the tip of one's tongue ). From a sociolinguistic perspective,  look at historical and current influences on English vocabulary, including the role of dictionaries and spelling as a source of standardization.

Throughout recorded history, humans have conceptualized categories of sex and gender in a variety of ways; some have elaborated just two main sex/genders, others have elaborated more than two categories. At the same time, regardless of how a given culture has defined sex and gender and the behaviors and appearances deemed appropriate, humans have always exceeded those definitions. Quite simply, the determination of male and female and any other sex or gender category is neither obvious nor simple: what is sex, what is gender? Do they reside in the body, behavior, psyche, clothing, or social processes such as racialization? To make matters still more complicated, cultural beliefs about sex/gender have changed across time. How have contacts across cultures through migration and colonization affected people's understanding of sex/gender possibilities and norms? This course focuses on sex/gender crossing and variation in historical contexts including Japan, South Africa, Europe, the African diaspora, and North America. We will consider perspectives of people who themselves passed, crossed, transitioned, transed, or otherwise exceeded their culture's definitions of normative sex/gender. Alongside, we will consider the ways that dominant social institutions reinforced norms, recognized, tolerated, punished and/or celebrated gender variation. We will examine popular culture, medical and legal perspectives, memoir, queer and trans theory, and social movement treatises. Enroll Info: None",3 credits., — ANTHROPOLOGY BY WOMEN

Uses writing in many forms and genres to help students explore how race, gender, and sexuality intersect with language and inform textual experiences. From marriage licenses, passports, and don't ask, don't tell policies to literacy requirements and gag rules, written texts have played major roles in enforcing expectations about race and sex in the United States. At the same time, anti-slavery petitions, letters to the editor, wheat-pasted posters, and hashtag activism all also harness the power of writing to challenge and revise those expectations. In light of that active textual production and negotiation, this class traces public debates and daily experiences where people write or talk about race and sex in order to make a difference. Ultimately, the class takes on the power of words to break bones and heal wounds. Through reading and writing informed by scholarship in writing studies and rhetoric, students in this class will examine historical and contemporary interconnections among race, sexuality, gender, and texts in the United States, developing analytical tools for understanding how language works on and in their world.

Human-induced factors such as changes in land use and global climate are causing rapid worldwide biodiversity loss. Can modern molecular genetics contribute to species preservation? In this course, we will first explore the challenges and potential of molecular genetic methods based on biobanking, gene editing and nuclear transfer for animal biodiversity preservation. Topics covered will include: i) maternal factors and early animal development, ii) interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (isSCNT) and oocyte-mediated reprogramming in animal cloning, iii) developmental, phylogenetic and ecological considerations for biobanking, iv) gene editing and synthetic biology as potential tools to recapture biodiversity.

All organisms are Systems that Evolve in their Biological contexts. EvoSysBio focuses on this bigger picture. How do intra- organismal and trans-organismal processes interact during evolution? Accurate answers require trans-disciplinary collaborations for building diverse model-ensembles, from biochemistry to ecology. Investigating biological systems of their choice, students are gently introduced to aspects of quantitative modeling, data science, and biological model curation, while learning the Evolvix modeling language for running simulations to support a collaborative grant proposal presented at the end. Students actively learn to (i) link models to observable data they curate, (ii) make predictions and quantify their uncertainty, (iii) define and limit the scope of models using critical thinking, causal analysis, and independent research skills, and (iv) communicate across disciplinary boundaries.This course is open to all aiming to grow their modeling skills at any level. All modeling problems can be simplified, or rendered unsolvable by poor boundary choices. Thus, students from different disciplines can customize their learning.

Franz Kafka (1883-1924) is an author whose impact on world literature cannot be overestimated. Born an Austrian Jew and living in the German-speaking Diaspora of Prague, he spent his days making a living as a successful employee of an insurance company and his nights desperately trying to create fiction that met his own exacting expectations. Constantly at odds with the demands of his family, friends, and fiancées/female acquaintances and plagued by poor health, Franz Kafka struggled his entire life long to reconcile the irreconcilable: life and writing. Kafka's texts demand a transdisciplinary and comparative approach. They forged a new level and quality of literature that has triggered innumerable responses in many languages, media, and discourses. The term ""Kafkaesque"" makes clear that the type and dimension of Kafka's texts have been perceived as strange, uncanny, and resistant to any classification. In the attempt to adopt or imitate the Kafkaesque, other authors situate themselves in the literary tradition of the uncanny, which in part relies on the mystified city of Prague with its long Jewish tradition, as well as on the tradition of Romantic and ""Gothic"" texts. In this course, we will read a wide selection of texts by Franz Kafka in order to approach an understanding of his universe and prepare ourselves to view this universe in comparison with other contemporary authors as well as authors from other cultures and eras (A. Camus,, W. G. Sebald, T. Pynchon, H. Mulisch, P. Roth, H. Murakami). Lectures will also highlight literature, film, and art works in the tradition of the Kafkaesque.

From Teddy Roosevelt's 1909 African safari to the Hollywood blockbuster King Kong, from the world of Walt Disney to The March of the Penguins, cinema has been a powerful force in shaping public and scientific understanding of nature throughout the twentieth and twenty-first century. How can film shed light on changing environmental ideas and beliefs in American thought, politics, and culture? And how can we come to see and appreciate contested issues of race, class, and gender in nature on screen? This course will explore such questions as we come to understand the role of film in helping to define the contours of past, present, and future environmental visions in the United States, and their impact on the real world struggles of people and wildlife throughout the world.

From medical advancements to environmental crises and global food shortages, the life sciences are implicated in some of the most pressing social issues of our time. This course explores events in the history of biology from the mid-twentieth century to today, and examines how developments in this science have shaped and are shaped by society. In the first unit, we investigate the origins of the institutions, technologies, and styles of practice that characterize contemporary biology, such as the use of mice as ""model organisms"" for understanding human diseases. The second unit examines biological controversies such as the introduction of genetically modified plants into the food supply. The final unit asks how biological facts and theories have been and continue to be used as a source for understanding ourselves.

Plants provide not only the foundation of food, clothing, and shelter essential for human existence, but also some of the key raw materials for transcendence and abstraction through music, art, and spirituality. Since antiquity, we have co-evolved with plants and their derivative products, with each exerting a domesticating force on the other. It is, for example, impossible to think of our modern life without its plant-based accompaniments in the form of cotton, sugar, bread, coffee, and wood. Yet they are so ubiquitous we may forget they all derive from plants discovered, domesticated, bred, and farmed for millennia in a never-ending pursuit to improve our wellbeing. Explore major points of intersection between plants and human wellbeing from a horticultural point of view by highlighting a plant or group of plants that represent a primary commodity or resource through which humans have pursued their own aims and explore effects and impacts on human society.

An introduction to the human and environmental geography of Australia. Australia is a settler country, the scene of indigenous genocide, a former English colony, a mythical unknown, a biophysical puzzle, home to a startling diversity of life, a cradle of modern democracy, and a powerful industrial economy with a rich resource base. It thus serves in many ways as a mirror for the US - even matching the US roughly in size, if not in population. The two countries share many elements of a common history and biogeography and yet the human and environmental geographies of the two countries have traced very different paths into the modern world. This course provides a survey of Australian geology, ecology, society or culture. It will include weekly check-ins with current events in Australia and exercises that connect students to current resource management problems using Google Earth and other tools.

As much as we may try to convince ourselves that sport offers an escape from the ""real world,"" constant news of players' strikes, stadium financing controversies, and the lack of diversity in league management remind us that we cannot separate the games we play and watch from the political, social, and cultural contexts in which they are embedded. With this in mind, this course explores how sport has shaped and been shaped by major trends in American social, political, and economic history. Lectures and discussion sections will not focus on player stats or the morning edition of SportsCenter. Instead, students will engage with serious historical arguments and debates about sport's relationship to American capitalism, social movements, and urban development.

This course explores the history of places that have been called the American West since 1850. We start with incorporation, as the U.S. surveyed a West that had become American in name and tried to make it American in fact, a process that westerners resisted as often as they welcomed it. By the late 19th century, the West was an identifiable region with characteristic economic features, race relations, and federal ties, and it held a unique place in collective memory. In the 20th century, western distinctiveness faded in some ways and persisted in others, and western variants unfolded of the world wars, Depression, Cold War, and Vietnam War; civil rights; suburbanization and the New Right; environmentalism; immigration; and globalization. We employ economic, environmental, political, cultural, and social analyses, and attend to the dreams of many westerners: people of North American, Latin American, European, African, and Asian descent, and of all genders, classes, and sexualities.

This course will examine various economic, political, cultural and intellectual crises from the early modern period to the present, and focus on how people have tried to make sense of them and go beyond them.At the same time, we will attempt to provide a historical framework that takes into account discussions of globalization avant la lettre, such as Janet Abu-Lugod's now well-known Beyond European Hegemony.

This course investigates the complex history of European and American violence and war-making through the lens of race and religion. Taking a comparative approach, we analyze several major conflicts of the twentieth century, from World War I to the wars of decolonization, and from the genocide of the Herero peoples to the Armenian Genocide, the Holocaust, and beyond. How did religious forces and racial claims shape these conflicts? How did these wars reinforce the modern notion of the nation-state, and strengthen both racist and anti-racist movements? Key topics in the class include the genealogy of the modern idea of ""race"" in Europe and the U.S.; the drive towards a world of more homogeneous nation-states after World War I; and the emergence of transnational protest movements opposed to racism, imperialism, antisemitism, and Islamophobia. Drawing on a range of texts, songs, and films, the course will investigate new connections between Europe and the United States. Join us as we take an international look at concepts like race and nation, and try to make sense of extreme violence, war-making, and the pre-requisites of peace.

The course revolves around three interrelated themes--war, revolution, and society--all of which allow us to place Eastern Europe within broader comparative contexts. In addition to exploring significant political, economic, and cultural changes, we'll discover how ordinary people--including workers, peasants, women, and children--experienced attempts to change the region and its people. Throughout, we will discuss how East Europeans continue to wrestle with the ghosts of their past today. Enroll Info: None",3-4 credits.,

An introduction to the major empirical and theoretical themes in the study of social movements and politics in Latin America. While it is impossible to cover every theoretical approach or Latin American case during the semester, the course should give students the tools to begin to think critically about where and why people engage in collective action. We will develop and hone these tools through thinking about Latin American cases, paying specific attention to revolutions, social movements, and riots. The course is designed in three parts. It begins by exposing students to the dominant theoretical paradigms in the study of contentious politics as well as some prominent critiques. The course then turns to empirical themes in Latin American revolutions, challenging students to use and question the theoretical tools to which they have already been exposed. The final part of the course looks to social movements in Latin America. Cases will focus on challenges to dictatorships, identity-based movements, and resistance to globalization.

This course explores the socio-economic and political outcomes across India. This course will employ the major theories of comparative politics that explain political outcomes such as regime type, economic development and conflict. This course explores why some countries are democracies, while others are dictatorships; why some countries are poor, while others are rich; and why some countries experience high levels of violence, while others are peaceful. The course considers how India comports with standard theories in comparative politics and how standard theories might be revised in light of the Indian case. The course maps variation on the sub-national and regional level. The course will ultimately consider reforms proposed by the Indian state to further democratic and economic development and to reduce conflict. Students will learn about India's politics in a structured manner, and will gain an appreciation of the power and limitations of the political science method.

What motivates us to try to alleviate the suffering of people in distant parts of the world? This is one of the questions that threads through this course on the global history of humanitarianism. Examine the origins of humanitarian ideas and institutions, and how various humanitarian campaigns have been shaped by geopolitical processes, including the abolition of the slave trade, the spread of missionary Christianity, European imperialism, the Cold War, neoliberalism and the emergence of new media forms. Questions include: who has benefited from various humanitarian aid campaigns throughout history? How have various humanitarian campaigns shaped, and been shaped by, patterns of global inequality? Why have some populations, and not others, been deemed worthy of the world's compassion? We will explore the worlds, perspectives and visions of humanitarians through a range of primary sources, including diary entries, political propaganda, memoirs, journalistic reportage, photography and documentary film.

Investigates how everyday people shaped European history and politics, from World War I through the student uprisings of 1968. Taking a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, we analyze a range of major social movements in Europe, thinking in detail about what constitutes a social movement in the first place, and what determines its effectiveness. Key topics in the class include the rise and fall of Fascism; the fate of the Communist and Socialist Left in Europe; the role of youth movements as drivers of change; and the constraints imposed on political organizing by both democratic and authoritarian societies. Drawing on a range of texts, songs, and films, this course will investigate how people power has shaped the European state, and vice-versa, from 1922 through 1968.

Why have some populations, and not others, been deemed worthy of the world's compassion?

Throughout recorded history, humans have conceptualized categories of sex and gender in a variety of ways; some have elaborated just two main sex/genders, others have elaborated more than two categories. At the same time, regardless of how a given culture has defined sex and gender and the behaviors and appearances deemed appropriate, humans have always exceeded those definitions. Quite simply, the determination of male and female and any other sex or gender category is neither obvious nor simple: what is sex, what is gender? Do they reside in the body, behavior, psyche, clothing, or social processes such as racialization? To make matters still more complicated, cultural beliefs about sex/gender have changed across time. How have contacts across cultures through migration and colonization affected people's understanding of sex/gender possibilities and norms? This course focuses on sex/gender crossing and variation in historical contexts including Japan, South Africa, Europe, the African diaspora, and North America. We will consider perspectives of people who themselves passed, crossed, transitioned, transed, or otherwise exceeded their culture's definitions of normative sex/gender. Alongside, we will consider the ways that dominant social institutions reinforced norms, recognized, tolerated, punished and/or celebrated gender variation. We will examine popular culture, medical and legal perspectives, memoir, queer and trans theory, and social movement treatises.

The experience and legacy of the First World War has been linked to nearly every social, cultural, and political transformation that marked the short century that followed: mobilization and the experience of total war transformed the relations between governments and citizens, between men and women, and between social classes. Europeans experienced death on an unprecedented scale and came to terms with new forms of industrialized warfare, from the use of poison gas to modern practices of genocide. Europeans now learned to live with violence, both during as well as after the war, and found new ways to mourn or remember the dead. This course will explore such themes. Using a wide variety of contemporary sources -- memoirs, essays, poems, or cinematic representations -- we will try to situate the upheaval of 1914-1918 within the larger framework of twentieth-century European history.

Provides a critical examination of the history of labor and working people in the Americas, from the colonial era to the present. It focuses on the experience of the United States and Mexico, offering a comparative perspective on their distinct but also shared (and increasingly linked) histories. The seminar proceeds chronologically, highlighting major episodes in the evolution of labor systems in the two countries, beginning with the colonial labor systems implemented by the Spanish and British empires following the European conquest of the Western Hemisphere. Among other topics, we will examine the pivotal role of slavery and other forms of forced labor, the impact of the industrial revolution, the emergence and expansion of corporate capitalism and the labor unrest it provoked in the post-civil war U.S., the role of labor in the Mexican Revolution and its aftermath, the impact of the Great Depression and labor incorporation on the post-WWII social and political order of both countries, the breakdown of that order and the move to neo-liberalism in the 1970s and 1980s, and the emergence of an increasingly integrated North American production system and its consequences for labor and working people on both sides of the US-Mexico border.

Explores the French Revolution and the Age of Napoleon. Why did Revolution break out in one of the most powerful and traditional monarchies of Europe? What were the roots of discontent and the sources of revolutionary ideas? Probes the exciting twists and turns of revolutionary politics and the attempt to spread ""liberty  equality"" into ordinary life, even abolishing slavery in response to massive slave revolt in the French colonies. Asks how the French interacted with a transnational revolutionary movement across Europe, the US, and the Atlantic world. Though focused on a specific revolutionary era, the course also aims to reflect on timeless questions: Why is it so difficult to create democracy? Is violence ever justified to overcome oppression and injustice? Finally, why did this experiment in radical democracy also unleash the Terror and launch Napoleon Bonaparte, the politician and general who built an astonishing European Empire?

This course is intended to help students understand World War II from the perspective of Asia. The focus is not only on the American and Japanese roles in the war but also on lesser, often overlooked participants such as China, Korea, and Southeast Asia. The course will focus not only on the diplomatic, political, and military situation of wartime Asia, but also on perceptions and experiences of the war from those most heavily affected by it: those experiencing it on the ground. Understanding this war is critical for helping us understand contemporary Asia. The foundations of the Cold War and the post-Cold War world that we live in today were forged on battlefields in mainland China, Burma, small islands in the Pacific, and in the skies over the archipelago of Japan. In order to provide the background and understand the legacies, this course covers an extended time frame, beginning in the 19th century with the arrival of the West in Asia and continues into the 1950s.

Investigates how everyday people shaped European history and politics, from World War I through the student uprisings of 1968. Taking a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, we analyze a range of major social movements in Europe, thinking in detail about what constitutes a social movement in the first place, and what determines its effectiveness. Key topics in the class include the rise and fall of Fascism; the fate of the Communist and Socialist Left in Europe; the role of youth movements as drivers of change; and the constraints imposed on political organizing by both democratic and authoritarian societies. Drawing on a range of texts, songs, and films, this course will investigate how people power has shaped the European state, and vice-versa, from 1922 through 1968.

From the microbes that inhabit our guts to political revolutions sparked by a tweet, human lives are embedded in an ecology of complex, interdependent systems. Using the lens of Human Ecology, you will address ""big questions"" like: How am I connected to others and to larger systems? What brings happiness and works for the ""greater good"" in human lives? An overarching goal of the course is to help you understand yourself as embedded in the web of ever-evolving interconnected networks, an ""EcoYou."" Human Ecology is a systems approach to studying and understanding relationships between humans and their everyday environments; it is a civic and socially conscious orientation that is committed to understanding and improving the quality of human lives. Human Ecology is inherently interdisciplinary drawing on research, theories and methods from diverse fields such as sociology, psychology, anthropology, economics, public health, biology, and art and design.

Among other topics, we will examine the pivotal role of slavery and other forms of forced labor, the impact of the industrial revolution, the emergence and expansion of corporate capitalism and the labor unrest it provoked in the post-civil war U.S., the role of labor in the Mexican Revolution and its aftermath, the impact of the Great Depression and labor incorporation on the post-WWII social and political order of both countries, the breakdown of that order and the move to neo-liberalism in the 1970s and 1980s, and the emergence of an increasingly integrated North American production system and its consequences for labor and working people on both sides of the US-Mexico border.

Offers a general primer on large-scale policies directed by US federal and state governments, with specific examples in pressing policy areas. The class does not intend to do certain things, such as consider rationales for government intervention, or explain different stages of the policy process. Other classes in political science and economics perform such tasks well. Instead, it takes existing policies and the policy process as a given, explains them in detail, and puts a policy focus on very specific contemporary questions of concern to policymakers. A student of this class will gain a broad overall knowledge of how the majority of state and federal funding is spent and the policy outcomes associated with that spending.

Leadership is one of the most important but perplexing topics in the public sector; almost all agree its important, but we often disagree about what it actually means, or how to study it. This course aims to demystify the role of leadership in a public setting. We will draw on research from public management, psychology and organization studies to help students how leadership manifests itself in the public sector. This means understanding how to set goals, the motivation of those around you, how to engage and negotiate with stakeholders, managing change, making decisions, and exhibiting ethical behavior. The class will mix research with practical examples. The class starts with the assumption that while there are some general traits relevant across public, private and non-profit sectors, the nature of these sectors is different, and this affects how these traits function in practice.

How powerful is non-military power? What are its vectors and its limits? International relations theorists have defined soft power as ""the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion."" This graduate seminar will put this notion to the test. We will investigate how elites, interest groups, religious bodies, and nation-states seek to exercise hegemony in the international order through non-violent means. How was ""soft power"" implemented on the ground in the 20th century- and how did its use transform international relations? To probe these questions, we will focus on a series of case studies in European and U.S. international history. Topics covered include the expansion of capitalism and consumer culture; the globalization of international legal instruments and human rights claims; and de-secularization, religious radicalism, and counter-insurgency. In the process of analyzing our case studies, we will refine our analytical vocabulary. Drawing on recent work in international relations, political theory, and international history, we will probe the meaning and utility of concepts like normative power, hegemony, cultural capital, and public diplomacy.

From medical advancements to environmental crises and global food shortages, the life sciences are implicated in some of the most pressing social issues of our time. This course explores events in the history of biology from the mid-twentieth century to today, and examines how developments in this science have shaped and are shaped by society. In the first unit, we investigate the origins of the institutions, technologies, and styles of practice that characterize contemporary biology, such as the use of mice as ""model organisms"" for understanding human diseases. The second unit examines biological controversies such as the introduction of genetically modified plants into the food supply.

Focuses on ethical issues implicated in a population-level approach to disease prevention and health promotion.  Explores prominent theoretical approaches to public health ethics and engages with several ethical tensions.  Issues discussed can include:  the use of coercive or intrusive public health interventions that restrict individual freedom, infringe upon individual privacy, and/or invite individual harm (or risks of harm); the justification of patemalistic measures in societies or sub-populations that seemingly indulge in pleasurable yet unhealthy behaviors; the extent to which societies should hold individuals responsible for their health conditions; the need to decide who receives life-saving treatment or vaccination when not all can; the need to choose between the identifiable victims we can save with expensive measures here and now and the more numerous unidentifiable victims we could save in the future with the same monetary investment; the trade-offs between maximizing aggregate health benefits and addressing the special needs of vulnerable social sub-groups and individuals; climate changes and intergenerational justice; ethical issues in international pharmaceutical research, and the need to establish reasonable limits to public health demands in a world where health outcomes are profoundly influenced by policies in other domains (such as transportation, housing, unemployment, and education) that generate their own ethical problems and imperatives.

Explores how a humanistic perspective can broaden our understanding of health and medicine. Specifically, we will examine the role of language and culture in the creation and circulation of biomedical knowledge; our lived experiences with illness (physical and mental); the intricate intersections of race, gender, sexuality, disability and medicine; the political dimensions of diagnosis, disease, and epidemics, and the role that fiction, creative non-fiction, comics, and film play in shaping our experiences with health and medicine as health care providers and as patients. The course does not assume any background in science or medicine. One of our recurrent topics, in fact, will be to consider how non-experts interact with medicine and its technical vocabularies. Although the primary objective of the course is to understand the cultural, social, and political dimensions of health and medicine, a secondary objective is for students to become more savvy patients and, for the few students who might emerge on the other side of the stethoscope one day, more well rounded health care professionals.

This course is unique among the graduate curricula, introducing students to the pathogenesis of disease via integration of actual autopsy patient cases. Emphasis is placed on understanding the basic mechanisms of disease at the level of cell, organ, and body, as well as the morphologic expression patterns of selected common specific disease processes. In addition to attending twice-weekly lectures, students will participate in weekly autopsy gross organ conferences as well as microscopic review sessions. In this way, the concepts covered in lectures will be applied and reinforced in the interactive autopsy sessions. Students will also observe at least one full autopsy, gaining a three-dimensional understanding of structure and disease. The grade for this course is derived from a final multiple-choice exam and a short essay regarding an autopsy case. At the conclusion of this course, students should: gain an appreciation of how disease processes directly impact patients; be able to distinguish the morphologic patterns of normal versus pathologic tissues; be familiar with the pathogenesis of selected common disease processes; and recognize how basic laboratory research may be applied to specific disease processes.

Focuses on ethical issues implicated in a population-level approach to disease prevention and health promotion.  Explores prominent theoretical approaches to public health ethics and engages with several ethical tensions.  Issues discussed can include:  the use of coercive or intrusive public health interventions that restrict individual freedom, infringe upon individual privacy, and/or invite individual harm (or risks of harm); the justification of patemalistic measures in societies or sub-populations that seemingly indulge in pleasurable yet unhealthy behaviors; the extent to which societies should hold individuals responsible for their health conditions; the need to decide who receives life-saving treatment or vaccination when not all can; the need to choose between the identifiable victims we can save with expensive measures here and now and the more numerous unidentifiable victims we could save in the future with the same monetary investment; the trade-offs between maximizing aggregate health benefits and addressing the special needs of vulnerable social sub-groups and individuals; climate changes and intergenerational justice; ethical issues in international pharmaceutical research, and the need to establish reasonable limits to public health demands in a world where health outcomes are profoundly influenced by policies in other domains (such as transportation, housing, unemployment, and education) that generate their own ethical problems and imperatives.

This course will deepen our understanding of how health is produced over the life course. A life course approach focuses on how early life experiences influence health across lives and possibly generations. This includes the concept of ""linked lives"" or how health is produced in the context of familial and social relationships. Using a life course and human development framework, we will explore a number of concepts explaining how exposures in early life lead to health outcomes at later life stages. Namely, we will examine critical or sensitive periods (i.e., ""Barker hypothesis"" or ""fetal or biological programming""), cumulative effects, pathways and trajectories, risk and resilience, and  intergenerational impacts (transmission of health across one or more  generations). Through this lens, we will consider the biobehavioral processes that underlie the development of health across the life course. Together this  theoretical and empirical evidence will be applied to the understanding of the evolution and persistence of health disparities. Data sources, study designs,  and statistical approaches used in life course epidemiology and family health services research will also be reviewed and evaluated. Finally, we will explore implications for clinical and public health practice, policy, and health system development with an eye towards the development of effective and sustainable life course interventions. We will conclude the course with an in-depth examination of three case-studies that will allow the students to apply their knowledge to specific life course and family health services research examples. The purpose of this course is to provide students with a foundation for understanding: 1) the terminology and theoretical framework used in life  course epidemiology and family health services research; 2) biobehavioral pathways by which early life experiences impact health across the life course; 3) the data sources, study designs, and statistical approaches used in life course epidemiology and family health services research; 4) the implications for clinical and public health practice, policy, and health system development with an eye towards the development of effective and sustainable life course interventions.

Focuses on the role that psychological principles, research evidence and social science play in the laws of U.S. society, especially in the policies and mechanisms of social control of human behavior. The course will address the ways that society defines membership, and the role of psychology in how it determines who should be excluded or restricted from open society, in order to maintain a more civil society. In addition to learning the factual information about how selected processes work in the legal and social context, students will be asked to consider the role they can play as citizens in supporting or changing these social processes. The course will take a particular interest in psycholegal issues ""in action"" and in learning about the clinical-legal processes used to determine the disposition of individuals considered marginal in society. Finally, the course will address the mechanisms that are used to exclude individuals from open society through criminal and civil court processes, the role of psychology as a science, and the role of psychologists as behavioral experts in criminal and civil courts, and in shaping social policies.

An introduction to the major empirical and theoretical themes in the study of social movements and politics in Latin America. While it is impossible to cover every theoretical approach or Latin American case during the semester, the course should give students the tools to begin to think critically about where and why people engage in collective action. We will develop and hone these tools through thinking about Latin American cases, paying specific attention to revolutions, social movements, and riots. The course is designed in three parts. It begins by exposing students to the dominant theoretical paradigms in the study of contentious politics as well as some prominent critiques. The course then turns to empirical themes in Latin American revolutions, challenging students to use and question the theoretical tools to which they have already been exposed. The final part of the course looks to social movements in Latin America. Cases will focus on challenges to dictatorships, identity-based movements, and resistance to globalization.

Complex social behavior emerges from the interplay of hormones, the brain and environmental signals. This course is structured to introduce psychology and neurobiology students to how hormones and neurotransmitters shape brain and behavior in animals and humans. We will review the mechanisms by which hormones shape brain sex differences and its consequences on juvenile (i.e. play) and adult behavior. We will discuss how hormones influence sexual behavior using basic animal models, and extend this to human sex differences, including sexual orientation. Additional topics include how hormones shape competitive and affiliative behaviors, eating disorders, and stress and mental health. We will also discuss how individual variation occurs in response to the changing environment and genetic landscape, including epigenetics at an introductory level.

This class will take you on a tour of how humans conceptualize the world, focusing on the role of language in thought. We will begin by discussing the evolution of language and how it relates to other communication systems used by humans and nonhuman animals. We will then discuss the relationship between language, culture, and cognition in domains as varied as mathematics, visual perception, spatial navigation, and theory of mind. In the process, we will tackle questions such as: What is the role of language in making us human? Can speaking a particular language allow the speakers to better adapt to their environment? Can we create new languages to improve human thought? We will also address such issues as metaphors in political discourse and propaganda, and the role of information technologies in the spread of ideas. This class will draw heavily on empirical research in cognitive and developmental psychology as well as neuroscience.
