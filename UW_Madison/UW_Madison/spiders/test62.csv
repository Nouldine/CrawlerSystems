In recent years, a large number of open access biological and biomedical databases have become available for on-line, computer based research. Among these databases are the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Allen Brain Atlas, NIH DAVID, Genemania, ToppClusterPhenopedia, GeneNetwork, GWAS Central, and Broad Institute's MSIgDB. Within these and other sites is a wealth of information regarding genes, gene expression, gene pathways, behavioral characteristics, and disorders or diseases, such as autism, arthritis, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Learning to navigate the various sites to take advantage of the information and push scientific discovery forward is a valuable skill to develop for any student interested in a career in science or medicine. In the early part of this laboratory course, students will be guided through a range of databases and shown how to extract information to develop new ideas. A key part of the course is that each student will pick a disease or disorder of interest (e.g., autism, arthritis, epilepsy, schizophrenia) and use multiple databases to develop new ideas on which genes may be playing important, but previously underappreciated or unknown roles.
