This course explores the history of places that have been called the American West since 1850. We start with incorporation, as the U.S. surveyed a West that had become American in name and tried to make it American in fact, a process that westerners resisted as often as they welcomed it. By the late 19th century, the West was an identifiable region with characteristic economic features, race relations, and federal ties, and it held a unique place in collective memory. In the 20th century, western distinctiveness faded in some ways and persisted in others, and western variants unfolded of the world wars, Depression, Cold War, and Vietnam War; civil rights; suburbanization and the New Right; environmentalism; immigration; and globalization. We employ economic, environmental, political, cultural, and social analyses, and attend to the dreams of many westerners: people of North American, Latin American, European, African, and Asian descent, and of all genders, classes, and sexualities.

Provides a critical examination of the history of labor and working people in the Americas, from the colonial era to the present. It focuses on the experience of the United States and Mexico, offering a comparative perspective on their distinct but also shared (and increasingly linked) histories. The seminar proceeds chronologically, highlighting major episodes in the evolution of labor systems in the two countries, beginning with the colonial labor systems implemented by the Spanish and British empires following the European conquest of the Western Hemisphere. Among other topics, we will examine the pivotal role of slavery and other forms of forced labor, the impact of the industrial revolution, the emergence and expansion of corporate capitalism and the labor unrest it provoked in the post-civil war U.S., the role of labor in the Mexican Revolution and its aftermath, the impact of the Great Depression and labor incorporation on the post-WWII social and political order of both countries, the breakdown of that order and the move to neo-liberalism in the 1970s and 1980s, and the emergence of an increasingly integrated North American production system and its consequences for labor and working people on both sides of the US-Mexico border.

This course explores the history of places that have been called the American West since 1850. We start with incorporation, as the U.S. surveyed a West that had become American in name and tried to make it American in fact, a process that westerners resisted as often as they welcomed it. By the late 19th century, the West was an identifiable region with characteristic economic features, race relations, and federal ties, and it held a unique place in collective memory. In the 20th century, western distinctiveness faded in some ways and persisted in others, and western variants unfolded of the world wars, Depression, Cold War, and Vietnam War; civil rights; suburbanization and the New Right; environmentalism; immigration; and globalization. We employ economic, environmental, political, cultural, and social analyses, and attend to the dreams of many westerners: people of North American, Latin American, European, African, and Asian descent, and of all genders, classes, and sexualities.

Provides a critical examination of the history of labor and working people in the Americas, from the colonial era to the present. It focuses on the experience of the United States and Mexico, offering a comparative perspective on their distinct but also shared (and increasingly linked) histories. The seminar proceeds chronologically, highlighting major episodes in the evolution of labor systems in the two countries, beginning with the colonial labor systems implemented by the Spanish and British empires following the European conquest of the Western Hemisphere. Among other topics, we will examine the pivotal role of slavery and other forms of forced labor, the impact of the industrial revolution, the emergence and expansion of corporate capitalism and the labor unrest it provoked in the post-civil war U.S., the role of labor in the Mexican Revolution and its aftermath, the impact of the Great Depression and labor incorporation on the post-WWII social and political order of both countries, the breakdown of that order and the move to neo-liberalism in the 1970s and 1980s, and the emergence of an increasingly integrated North American production system and its consequences for labor and working people on both sides of the US-Mexico border.
