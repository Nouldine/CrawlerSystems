Can HipHop culture help produce a more just world? If so, what theory and praxis best advance this aim? These are the questions that drive this conceptual course. Our critical interrogation of the relationship between HipHop and social justice considers the culture from its U.S. Black Power era underpinnings to its disparate contemporary ""glocal"" manifestations. We begin by asking what is ""HipHop,"" what is ""social justice,"" and what is their relationship, and proceed to consider how HipHop can be an effective force for social justice and what obstacles mitigate against this potential. These discussions will develop familiarity with important concepts in Black studies and social theory such as race and colonialism, imperialism and hegemony, structure and agency, identity and strategic essentialism. Weekly readings will typically pair writings specifically on HipHop with theory from across the humanities and social sciences including philosophy, sociology, cultural studies, and political economy. We will endeavor to consider the race/class/gender dimensions of our weekly topics. Students will acquire a broader familiarity with HipHop activism, and develop new conceptual tools and critical thinking skills. Enroll Info: None

Can HipHop culture help produce a more just world? If so, what theory and praxis best advance this aim? These are the questions that drive this conceptual course. Our critical interrogation of the relationship between HipHop and social justice considers the culture from its U.S. Black Power era underpinnings to its disparate contemporary ""glocal"" manifestations. We begin by asking what is ""HipHop,"" what is ""social justice,"" and what is their relationship, and proceed to consider how HipHop can be an effective force for social justice and what obstacles mitigate against this potential. These discussions will develop familiarity with important concepts in Black studies and social theory such as race and colonialism, imperialism and hegemony, structure and agency, identity and strategic essentialism. Weekly readings will typically pair writings specifically on HipHop with theory from across the humanities and social sciences including philosophy, sociology, cultural studies, and political economy. We will endeavor to consider the race/class/gender dimensions of our weekly topics. Students will acquire a broader familiarity with HipHop activism, and develop new conceptual tools and critical thinking skills. Enroll Info: None

",3-4,THEORY OF AFRICAN LITERATURE
Sophomore standing,AFRICAN 403,"
This course is a study of the many ways of understanding the entire spectrum of culture and cultural production, circulation, consumption, and meaning making in Africa. It foregrounds material and imaginative cultural forms and practices-their origins, languages, contents, forms, functions, genres, audiences-as well as how these have been conceived and theorized by practitioners and scholars in the context of Africa and the world. The course will also examine the uses to which particular meanings of culture and its forms are put, by whom, and to what purpose, and how meanings are fought over, reshaped, and reconstituted, and under what conditions those are or can be possible. This is what ""theory of African cultural studies"" means in its most robust and imaginative senses. We will survey the entrenched modes of both conceptual and critical apprehension of the cultural forms and practices (from Negritude to postcolonialism and postmodernism), explore their methods of reading, raise the issue of their linkages to sources in Euro-America, and assess the extent to which the unique concerns of the biography of culture in Africa (expressed by its creators and scholars) have tried to tame and refashion what are now globally shared critical tools of cultural reading.

None,AN SCI 444,"
This course is designed as an immersion experience based on the gradual release methodology of information delivery. Students are engaged in active/process learning whereby the principles and themes presented in the lecture portion of the course are immediately put into practice in the laboratory component of the course. Expected learning outcomes and learning objectives are therefore integrated into each lecture and laboratory. Each subsequent learning objective builds upon the knowledge acquired from the previous learning objective thus developing a scaffold or framework from which to proceed. This course will present students with challenges from cognitive and affective domains as they process information from both biological and ethical perspectives. Problem solving and conflict resolution skills will be displayed as students challenge themselves with the development of fine motor/coordination based skills as well as understanding that the product of their efforts has the potential to result in a live offspring. The bovine (cow/bull) will serve as our model in this performance-based course as students are expected to demonstrate competency in the nuances and complexities associated with the production of embryos in a completely artificial (in vitro) environment. The student will be expected to demonstrate critical thinking by developing a simulated professional enterprise involving one or more of the assisted reproductive technologies they are exposed to. Students will demonstrate proficiency in and competency of in vitro maturation, fertilization, embryo development, cell culture, sterile bench technique, synchronization of the female estrus cycle, embryo transfer, non-surgical embryo recovery and cryopreservation by completing 2 complete cycles of embryo production in vitro. Students work in teams of 3-4 individuals. During the first production cycle students will perform all tasks while observing and working alongside of the instructor. The second production cycle will require the students to perform independently (of the instructor) who will only intervene in the event that the actions of the student will be lethal to the process and/or outcome. Each week (Monday) students will be presented with a controversial subject or topic related to cellular biology and/or reproduction. These ethical dilemmas are almost entirely within the realm of human assisted reproduction. Using any means and/or media desired, students are required to formulate responses in favor and in opposition of said topic. Each Friday, following the course quiz, students will be randomly selected to defend one side of the argument by articulating their viewpoint from the assigned perspective even if it is not their personal opinion. The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate the nature and influence bioethics may have on policy decisions impacting future research endeavors and/or science based initiatives. As well, students will grapple with representing a viewpoint they may be in personal conflict with. Enroll Info: Animal Sciences 434 or consent of instructor

To this end we will read snippets from vastly popular works in the major genres of comic books, novellas, essays, poetry, kabuki and puppet plays and so on, concentrating on the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Some key questions in this course include: What is early modernity? What is literature? What is Japanese about these materials?

We will ask these questions with comparative intent: we want both to learn about cultures other than our own and, in the process of understanding the other, we will ask how this new knowledge might empower us to be more observant and critical of the role(s) and treatment of the body in our own society historically and today.

Examines the arts and cultures of Europe and the Mediterranean basin before the Renaissance. We explore canonical works such as the pyramids at Giza, the Parthenon in Athens, the Venus di Milo, Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, the Book of Kells, the Great Mosque at Córdoba, Chartres cathedral, and Giotto's Arena Chapel. But we also define art broadly, to encompass the material culture of everyday life, including jewelry, ceramics, and textiles. We consider the social and historical contexts of art and artistic production - art and imperialism, ethnicity, technology, religious ritual and belief, and myth and storytelling. These explorations address basic human concerns: death and the afterlife, desire and the body, self-definition and portraiture, power and propaganda, monstrosity and the supernatural, the divine and the sacred. We develop crucial skill sets: critical visual analysis, contextual interpretation, research methods and resources, historiography, and oral, written and digital communication. Students will apply these skills in assignments focused on works of art in the Chazen Museum. Enroll Info: None
",4,HISTORY OF WESTERN ART I: FROM PYRAMIDS TO CATHEDRALS

Examines the arts and cultures of Europe and North America from the Renaissance through the present. Our discussions will explore important masterpieces by such renowned artists as Leonardo da Vinci, Rembrandt van Rijn, Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne, Pablo Picasso, Frida Kahlo, and Frank Lloyd Wright alongside other works of fine art, architecture, the decorative arts, and photography. By studying the political, historical, social and cultural contexts of their making, we will begin to understand how certain works of art were valued from the moment of their making, fought over by different nations, bought, sold, stolen, or ignored for centuries and revived only recently for study. We will critically examine the concept of artistic genius; the influence of colonialism and imperialism on artistic production and consumption; the role of the patron and the art market in art's production and circulation; the relationship of fine art and popular culture; and the idea of globalization as it relates to ""western"" artistic traditions. Students will develop skills in visual analysis that can help them understand artistic production over the past 500 years as well as succeed in today's visually oriented culture. They will also learn about dominant interpretive approaches and research tools in art history that have applicability across the humanities as well as digital applications that will help them create online exhibitions. Many assignments will focus on works of art in the Chazen Museum of Art. Enroll Info: None

ART IS GLOBAL (and always has been). Today, we find Egyptian protest artists inspiring activists around the globe via the internet, but in earlier times, Roman glass and Buddhist icons moved along the ancient Silk Route, networks of exchange flourished in the medieval Mediterranean region, and colonial empires brought visual cultures into volatile contact. This course teaches students how to analyze images and objects produced through such exchanges that occurred around the world from ancient times through the contemporary. Its aims are to develop skills needed to live fully in a world in which borders are no barriers to the movement of images, objects, and ideas and to deepen understanding of cultural differences and interactions. By exploring works in a range of media and tracing processes of cross-cultural exchange, the course also develops sensitivity to visual and material form and a solid foundation in the practice of visual and material analysis.

This course considers the end of Modernist art as it gives way to what is called, problematically, contemporary art. While the term modern may generally mean what is vanguard or current, Modernism indicates a period of art (and the humanities) ranging from, arguably, 1880-1950. By considering its end, one can study four pivotal aspects of the movement: its origins, themes, and afterlives, as well as the art and histories that challenge its coherence. In this thematic survey, then, Modernism will emerge as a heterogeneous set of images and attendant discourses which, negatively or positively, continue to work within the contemporary artistic and cultural moment.

Over the course of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, painting in the Netherlands experienced dramatic technological advancements: the application of oil on panel allowed for an unprecedented richness of color; experiments with optics led to improved illusions of space; artists rendered light and reflections as never before. Did these advancements in depicting the natural world conflict with or enhance the portrayal of spiritual visions? Did realism pave the way for secular art? In this course, we will look critically at the relationship of science and art, tradition and innovation, the imagined and the experienced. The delicate preciousness of Jan van Eyck, the strange spaces of Petrus Christus, the bizarre hellscapes of Hieronymus Bosch, and the peasant festivals of Peter Bruegel will guide us through these themes.

This course critically reexamines concepts traditionally associated with the Renaissance by focusing on the exchange of artistic ideas throughout the Holy Roman Empire and across different media, such as altarpiece paintings, carved portraits, stained glass narratives, innovative uses of print, reappropriations of metalwork, and expressive uses of drawing. The course is organized thematically around four topics: religious art as piety and politics; antiquity as a source of tradition and imagination; the formulation of a public discourse that exposed social threats; and the distinctiveness of artistic claims of individual achievement. A motif throughout the course is the question of how the survival of fragments may be presented in museum contexts as parts standing in for an absent whole. Special topics address collecting, conservation, and technical research. We will also consider how historians approach designs for works of art now lost or never completed. Assignments focus on objects from the Chazen Museum and the Special Collections of Memorial Library. Enroll Info: Sophomore standing

This course examines the history of American Art from the period of permanent European settlement through the present. Works of art and other forms of material culture will be explored and discussed within the context of philosophical, historical, social, and cultural developments in the United States and across the globe. In this course, works of art and artifacts are interpreted not as passive objects that reflect history, but rather as active agents that are entwined with broader historical, social, and cultural events. A particular focus will be on the ways in which American art and material culture participates in the construction of identities - ranging from global identities and national identities (in particular, how notions of ""American"" have been constructed) to regional, group and individual identities. Although the course will mainly cover works of painting, sculpture, and architecture, other forms of material culture, especially photography, decorative arts and popular illustrations, will also be considered. Attention will also be given to the writings of artists and critics, as well as texts by contemporary art historians, historians, and other scholars that illustrate the variety of methods that are currently being brought to bear on the interpretation of American art, architecture, and material culture. Students will learn skills that will help them construct histories of American art and material culture in written narratives (papers) as well as in online exhibitions through a series of short research exercises. Outside of examinations, assignments will be tied to works of art on display at the Chazen Museum of Art or other local collections. Enroll Info: ART HIST 202

That entails familiarizing the class with movements ranging from color field painting, to postmodern production, to performance, video, and installation.

The tenth century CE marked a period of drastic change in the Islamic world, as the unified Islamic caliphate splintered into three rival dynasties: the Sunni Iraqi Abbasids, Spanish Umayyads, and the Shi'ite Fatimids in Egypt. In their quest to dominate the Islamic world and control the Mediterranean, each dynasty openly competed and responded to the others in architectural projects, ceremonial practices and courtly arts. At the same time, the monolithic model of courtly patronage of the arts was replaced gradually by one in which the urban classes increasingly shaped the art market, resulting in new visual forms. This course considers this turning point in the history of Islamic culture through the lens of art and architectural patronage. By exploring the architectural and urban projects of the three dynasties, we will examine competing visions of power, sources of legitimacy and the development of Cairo, Samarra and Cordoba as capital cities. We will also consider the role of portable arts, addressing the role of exchange and gift-giving in the Mediterranean context and the problems of attribution in this highly mobile environment. Course themes include the role of sectarian identity (Shi'ite vs Sunni); the incorporation of Christian and Jewish culture; the relation between the court and urban populations; and the meaning of ornament and style in Islamic art.

This directed study may serve as an elective for the new undergraduate certificate in Curatorial Studies, as an elective for the Material Culture certificate program, or for a specific stand-alone project. The goal is to give students credit for applied learning experiences in museums and other curatorial settings. Students must identify internship possibilities and have them approved for credit by the faculty member who will serve as instructor of record, and oversee the academic side of the internship. The nature of the internship will vary according to the host institution, but to be accepted for credit, it must have a substantial research component. Examples include but are not limited to: assisting a curator or registrar with research for an exhibition or permanent collection display; producing wall texts and object labels in an exhibition or permanent collection display; researching and writing catalog entries or essays on an object or objects in an exhibition or permanent collection; preparing catalog entries for works in the permanent collection of a museum/historical society; assisting a curator preparing a dossier for acquisitions; researching conservation histories of objects; provenance research; preparing teaching materials associated with an exhibition or permanent collection either in print of online; preparing and giving public tours of exhibitions or permanent collections; participating in exhibition design. To fulfill a 3-credit internship, the student must average approximately 12 hours a week throughout the semester, including working at the host institution on individual projects, and performing any necessary research and writing outside the host institution. In addition, the student should meet with the faculty advisor for a minimum of 1 hour each month. Enroll Info: None

This course explores the history of places that have been called the American West since 1850. We start with incorporation, as the U.S. surveyed a West that had become American in name and tried to make it American in fact, a process that westerners resisted as often as they welcomed it. By the late 19th century, the West was an identifiable region with characteristic economic features, race relations, and federal ties, and it held a unique place in collective memory. In the 20th century, western distinctiveness faded in some ways and persisted in others, and western variants unfolded of the world wars, Depression, Cold War, and Vietnam War; civil rights; suburbanization and the New Right; environmentalism; immigration; and globalization. We employ economic, environmental, political, cultural, and social analyses, and attend to the dreams of many westerners: people of North American, Latin American, European, African, and Asian descent, and of all genders, classes, and sexualities.

Aims to expose you to the changing uses of Wisconsin landscapes: as the home of native peoples; as a source of fur, lead and timber; as part of the new nation of the United States; and as a modern, vibrant collection of communities focused on enterprises as diverse as agriculture and education. We will ask: what roles did science play in shaping the landscape? What roles should it have played? What roles does science play in current land use? We will not be afraid to tackle controversy (genetically modified crops, the endangered species act, water use, global change), but we will remain committed to listening to, absorbing and respecting the diversity of experiences we may bring to the classroom.

Ancient monsters were forces of chaos that threatened the natural order of the universe: they had to be contained, banished to the edges of the world or destroyed. But the Greeks and Romans also believed them to be magical beings that held the promise of special knowledge - of the past, of dangers to be faced, of musical arts - or which, like the Sphinx, possessed an enigmatic intelligence capable of fooling all but the most cunning of mortals. In this course we investigate these contrasting aspects of ancient monsters, drawing directly on texts (in translation) and works of art through which the Greeks and Romans explored the monstrous and its place in their world. We also compare ancient representations with those in modern artistic media - comics, games, stories and movies - considering both how our notions of the monstrous are influenced by or contrast with those of our ancient predecessors, and how our very identities are created by and enacted through our depictions of monsters.

Focusing primarily on the world of the ancient Romans, this course (in translation) interrogates the phenomenon and notion of ""conspiracy"" within the political, social, and religious spheres. After investigating some of the more famous political conspiracies (e.g. the Catilinarian Conspiracy, assassination of Julius Caesar, etc.), we will then turn to the structure of the traditional Roman household, including the preeminence of the paterfamilias and the challenges that women, children, and/or slaves pose to his notional ""tyranny."" Finally, we will consider a number of prominent religions that came into conflict with Roman authorities - especially the mystery cults surrounding Bacchus as well as early Christianity. We will also have the opportunity to bring to bear the insights gleaned from the ancient world on the modern one in our consideration of such modern conspiracies as the Salem Witch Trials, the Red Scare of the '50s, the Kennedy Assassination, and the Watergate Conspiracy. As we shall see, ""conspiracy"" can be a tendentious concept that often reveals more about the society and culture in which it occurs (as well as the authors who write about it) than the actual activities it would seem to denote.

This course is intended to help students understand World War II from the perspective of Asia. The focus is not only on the American and Japanese roles in the war but also on lesser, often overlooked participants such as China, Korea, and Southeast Asia. The course will focus not only on the diplomatic, political, and military situation of wartime Asia, but also on perceptions and experiences of the war from those most heavily affected by it: those experiencing it on the ground. Understanding this war is critical for helping us understand contemporary Asia. The foundations of the Cold War and the post-Cold War world that we live in today were forged on battlefields in mainland China, Burma, small islands in the Pacific, and in the skies over the archipelago of Japan. In order to provide the background and understand the legacies, this course covers an extended time frame, beginning in the 19th century with the arrival of the West in Asia and continues into the 1950s.

This course will examine some common methods of multivariate data analysis in ecology and environmental science. Often called ""community data analysis,"" this class will cover methods for the analysis of complex, multidimensional datasets that are collected in the study of plant, invertebrate, fish, and bird communities. We will also address the concurrent analysis of the environmental factors that may drive community distributions. All of this provides the basis for predictive modeling of distributions across landscapes. General methods we will cover include ordination (PCA, DCA, NMDS, CCA), clustering (or classification), and other comparative analyses of data matrices (ANOSIM, Mantel tests). The ""class"" (better called a ""workshop"") is designed to be applied, meaning that the objective is for students to learn in a ""hands-on"" way how to use these tools, and the circumstances under which their uses are either appropriate or inappropriate.

Throughout recorded history, humans have conceptualized categories of sex and gender in a variety of ways; some have elaborated just two main sex/genders, others have elaborated more than two categories. At the same time, regardless of how a given culture has defined sex and gender and the behaviors and appearances deemed appropriate, humans have always exceeded those definitions. Quite simply, the determination of male and female and any other sex or gender category is neither obvious nor simple: what is sex, what is gender? Do they reside in the body, behavior, psyche, clothing, or social processes such as racialization? To make matters still more complicated, cultural beliefs about sex/gender have changed across time. How have contacts across cultures through migration and colonization affected people's understanding of sex/gender possibilities and norms? This course focuses on sex/gender crossing and variation in historical contexts including Japan, South Africa, Europe, the African diaspora, and North America. We will consider perspectives of people who themselves passed, crossed, transitioned, transed, or otherwise exceeded their culture's definitions of normative sex/gender. Alongside, we will consider the ways that dominant social institutions reinforced norms, recognized, tolerated, punished and/or celebrated gender variation. We will examine popular culture, medical and legal perspectives, memoir, queer and trans theory, and social movement treatises. Enroll Info: None

",3-4,WOMEN AND GENDER IN MODERN EUROPE
Sophomore standing,GEN&WS/​ENGL  401,"
Uses writing in many forms and genres to help students explore how race, gender, and sexuality intersect with language and inform textual experiences. From marriage licenses, passports, and don't ask, don't tell policies to literacy requirements and gag rules, written texts have played major roles in enforcing expectations about race and sex in the United States. At the same time, anti-slavery petitions, letters to the editor, wheat-pasted posters, and hashtag activism all also harness the power of writing to challenge and revise those expectations. In light of that active textual production and negotiation, this class traces public debates and daily experiences where people write or talk about race and sex in order to make a difference. Ultimately, the class takes on the power of words to break bones and heal wounds. Through reading and writing informed by scholarship in writing studies and rhetoric, students in this class will examine historical and contemporary interconnections among race, sexuality, gender, and texts in the United States, developing analytical tools for understanding how language works on and in their world.

All organisms are Systems that Evolve in their Biological contexts. EvoSysBio focuses on this bigger picture. How do intra- organismal and trans-organismal processes interact during evolution? Accurate answers require trans-disciplinary collaborations for building diverse model-ensembles, from biochemistry to ecology. Investigating biological systems of their choice, students are gently introduced to aspects of quantitative modeling, data science, and biological model curation, while learning the Evolvix modeling language for running simulations to support a collaborative grant proposal presented at the end. Students actively learn to (i) link models to observable data they curate, (ii) make predictions and quantify their uncertainty, (iii) define and limit the scope of models using critical thinking, causal analysis, and independent research skills, and (iv) communicate across disciplinary boundaries.This course is open to all aiming to grow their modeling skills at any level. All modeling problems can be simplified, or rendered unsolvable by poor boundary choices. Thus, students from different disciplines can customize their learning. Enroll Info: None

",3,ADVANCED COMPOSITION
Sophomore standing,ENGL/​GEN&WS  401,"
Uses writing in many forms and genres to help students explore how race, gender, and sexuality intersect with language and inform textual experiences. From marriage licenses, passports, and don't ask, don't tell policies to literacy requirements and gag rules, written texts have played major roles in enforcing expectations about race and sex in the United States. At the same time, anti-slavery petitions, letters to the editor, wheat-pasted posters, and hashtag activism all also harness the power of writing to challenge and revise those expectations. In light of that active textual production and negotiation, this class traces public debates and daily experiences where people write or talk about race and sex in order to make a difference. Ultimately, the class takes on the power of words to break bones and heal wounds. Through reading and writing informed by scholarship in writing studies and rhetoric, students in this class will examine historical and contemporary interconnections among race, sexuality, gender, and texts in the United States, developing analytical tools for understanding how language works on and in their world.

Sophomore standing,ENGL 413,"
Words and rules of combination (grammar) are the two basic building blocks of language. Looks at English words from different linguistic perspectives: As objects of grammar, words follow certain rules of combination (you wouldn't say ""these dog ), but they also have internal structure. For example, a word like ""hopefulness is fine, while ""hopenessful"" does not exist. From a psycholinguistic perspective examine how children learn these formal properties as well as the meaning of words. Study how words are stored in the mind and what one can learn from situations in which one cannot access the mental dictionary properly (for example, when one feels a word is on ""the tip of one's tongue ). From a sociolinguistic perspective,  look at historical and current influences on English vocabulary, including the role of dictionaries and spelling as a source of standardization.

Declared in the Health and the Humanities certificate,ENGL/​HIST SCI/​MED HIST  525,"
Explores how a humanistic perspective can broaden our understanding of health and medicine. Specifically, we will examine the role of language and culture in the creation and circulation of biomedical knowledge; our lived experiences with illness (physical and mental); the intricate intersections of race, gender, sexuality, disability and medicine; the political dimensions of diagnosis, disease, and epidemics, and the role that fiction, creative non-fiction, comics, and film play in shaping our experiences with health and medicine as health care providers and as patients. The course does not assume any background in science or medicine. One of our recurrent topics, in fact, will be to consider how non-experts interact with medicine and its technical vocabularies. Although the primary objective of the course is to understand the cultural, social, and political dimensions of health and medicine, a secondary objective is for students to become more savvy patients and, for the few students who might emerge on the other side of the stethoscope one day, more well rounded health care professionals.

The course learning objectives are: 1) To develop student's ability to conceive real world GIS development projects and design a plan for solving the projects; 2) To provide student the practical experience on managing GIS development projects; 3) To develop student's capacity to solve GIS development problems independently. Students taking this class will achieve these objectives in three stages. Stage 1: The students will be given a GIS development problem which will require them to define the context and the scope of a project to address this problem, to identify the key issues in solving this problems, and to develop implementation plan as well as to implement the plan. In this stage the students will be trained on their independence on developing strategies and solutions to the problems (issues) as they arise during the process of solving a GIS development project. Stage 2: The student is first asked to conceive, in consultation with the instructor(s), a project requiring substantial amount of GIS programming and development, and then to define the scope and to develop the implementation plan as well as to implement the plan for solving this GIS development project. During this stage, the students are trained to derive GIS development projects from real world situation on their own and solve the GIS development problems on their own. The instructors will act as the clients as well as technical advisors to the projects. Stage 3: students will summarize their experiences by reflections on various aspects of developing and implementing the above two projects to assess the learning outcomes for this classes and to provide recommendations for people who engage in this type of GIS development projects.

Sophomore standing,GERMAN 275,"
Franz Kafka (1883-1924) is an author whose impact on world literature cannot be overestimated. Born an Austrian Jew and living in the German-speaking Diaspora of Prague, he spent his days making a living as a successful employee of an insurance company and his nights desperately trying to create fiction that met his own exacting expectations. Constantly at odds with the demands of his family, friends, and fiancées/female acquaintances and plagued by poor health, Franz Kafka struggled his entire life long to reconcile the irreconcilable: life and writing. Kafka's texts demand a transdisciplinary and comparative approach. They forged a new level and quality of literature that has triggered innumerable responses in many languages, media, and discourses. The term ""Kafkaesque"" makes clear that the type and dimension of Kafka's texts have been perceived as strange, uncanny, and resistant to any classification. In the attempt to adopt or imitate the Kafkaesque, other authors situate themselves in the literary tradition of the uncanny, which in part relies on the mystified city of Prague with its long Jewish tradition, as well as on the tradition of Romantic and ""Gothic"" texts. In this course, we will read a wide selection of texts by Franz Kafka in order to approach an understanding of his universe and prepare ourselves to view this universe in comparison with other contemporary authors as well as authors from other cultures and eras (A. Camus,, W. G. Sebald, T. Pynchon, H. Mulisch, P. Roth, H. Murakami). Lectures will also highlight literature, film, and art works in the tradition of the Kafkaesque. Enroll Info: None

Plants provide not only the foundation of food, clothing, and shelter essential for human existence, but also some of the key raw materials for transcendence and abstraction through music, art, and spirituality. Since antiquity, we have co-evolved with plants and their derivative products, with each exerting a domesticating force on the other. It is, for example, impossible to think of our modern life without its plant-based accompaniments in the form of cotton, sugar, bread, coffee, and wood. Yet they are so ubiquitous we may forget they all derive from plants discovered, domesticated, bred, and farmed for millennia in a never-ending pursuit to improve our wellbeing.

",3,THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF SEX AND SEXUALITY
Declared in the Health and the Humanities certificate,HIST SCI/​ENGL/​MED HIST  525,"
Explores how a humanistic perspective can broaden our understanding of health and medicine. Specifically, we will examine the role of language and culture in the creation and circulation of biomedical knowledge; our lived experiences with illness (physical and mental); the intricate intersections of race, gender, sexuality, disability and medicine; the political dimensions of diagnosis, disease, and epidemics, and the role that fiction, creative non-fiction, comics, and film play in shaping our experiences with health and medicine as health care providers and as patients. The course does not assume any background in science or medicine. One of our recurrent topics, in fact, will be to consider how non-experts interact with medicine and its technical vocabularies. Although the primary objective of the course is to understand the cultural, social, and political dimensions of health and medicine, a secondary objective is for students to become more savvy patients and, for the few students who might emerge on the other side of the stethoscope one day, more well rounded health care professionals.

As much as we may try to convince ourselves that sport offers an escape from the ""real world,"" constant news of players' strikes, stadium financing controversies, and the lack of diversity in league management remind us that we cannot separate the games we play and watch from the political, social, and cultural contexts in which they are embedded. With this in mind, this course explores how sport has shaped and been shaped by major trends in American social, political, and economic history. Lectures and discussion sections will not focus on player stats or the morning edition of SportsCenter. Instead, students will engage with serious historical arguments and debates about sport's relationship to American capitalism, social movements, and urban development. Readings also provide a diverse set of perspectives on the politics of race, gender, and class in American sport in the twentieth century. Non-sports fans are welcome and encouraged to enroll!

Sophomore standing,HISTORY/​CHICLA  152,"

We start with incorporation, as the U.S. surveyed a West that had become American in name and tried to make it American in fact, a process that westerners resisted as often as they welcomed it. By the late 19th century, the West was an identifiable region with characteristic economic features, race relations, and federal ties, and it held a unique place in collective memory. In the 20th century, western distinctiveness faded in some ways and persisted in others, and western variants unfolded of the world wars, Depression, Cold War, and Vietnam War; civil rights; suburbanization and the New Right; environmentalism; immigration; and globalization. We employ economic, environmental, political, cultural, and social analyses, and attend to the dreams of many westerners: people of North American, Latin American, European, African, and Asian descent, and of all genders, classes, and sexualities.

This course investigates the complex history of European and American violence and war-making through the lens of race and religion. Taking a comparative approach, we analyze several major conflicts of the twentieth century, from World War I to the wars of decolonization, and from the genocide of the Herero peoples to the Armenian Genocide, the Holocaust, and beyond. How did religious forces and racial claims shape these conflicts? How did these wars reinforce the modern notion of the nation-state, and strengthen both racist and anti-racist movements? Key topics in the class include the genealogy of the modern idea of ""race"" in Europe and the U.S.; the drive towards a world of more homogeneous nation-states after World War I; and the emergence of transnational protest movements opposed to racism, imperialism, antisemitism, and Islamophobia. Drawing on a range of texts, songs, and films, the course will investigate new connections between Europe and the United States. Join us as we take an international look at concepts like race and nation, and try to make sense of extreme violence, war-making, and the pre-requisites of peace. Enroll Info: None

What motivates us to try to alleviate the suffering of people in distant parts of the world? This is one of the questions that threads through this course on the global history of humanitarianism. Examine the origins of humanitarian ideas and institutions, and how various humanitarian campaigns have been shaped by geopolitical processes, including the abolition of the slave trade, the spread of missionary Christianity, European imperialism, the Cold War, neoliberalism and the emergence of new media forms. Questions include: who has benefited from various humanitarian aid campaigns throughout history? How have various humanitarian campaigns shaped, and been shaped by, patterns of global inequality? Why have some populations, and not others, been deemed worthy of the world's compassion? We will explore the worlds, perspectives and visions of humanitarians through a range of primary sources, including diary entries, political propaganda, memoirs, journalistic reportage, photography and documentary film.

Throughout recorded history, humans have conceptualized categories of sex and gender in a variety of ways; some have elaborated just two main sex/genders, others have elaborated more than two categories. At the same time, regardless of how a given culture has defined sex and gender and the behaviors and appearances deemed appropriate, humans have always exceeded those definitions. Quite simply, the determination of male and female and any other sex or gender category is neither obvious nor simple: what is sex, what is gender? Do they reside in the body, behavior, psyche, clothing, or social processes such as racialization? To make matters still more complicated, cultural beliefs about sex/gender have changed across time. How have contacts across cultures through migration and colonization affected people's understanding of sex/gender possibilities and norms? This course focuses on sex/gender crossing and variation in historical contexts including Japan, South Africa, Europe, the African diaspora, and North America. We will consider perspectives of people who themselves passed, crossed, transitioned, transed, or otherwise exceeded their culture's definitions of normative sex/gender. Alongside, we will consider the ways that dominant social institutions reinforced norms, recognized, tolerated, punished and/or celebrated gender variation. We will examine popular culture, medical and legal perspectives, memoir, queer and trans theory, and social movement treatises. Enroll Info: None

The experience and legacy of the First World War has been linked to nearly every social, cultural, and political transformation that marked the short century that followed: mobilization and the experience of total war transformed the relations between governments and citizens, between men and women, and between social classes. Europeans experienced death on an unprecedented scale and came to terms with new forms of industrialized warfare, from the use of poison gas to modern practices of genocide. Europeans now learned to live with violence, both during as well as after the war, and found new ways to mourn or remember the dead. This course will explore such themes. Using a wide variety of contemporary sources -- memoirs, essays, poems, or cinematic representations -- we will try to situate the upheaval of 1914-1918 within the larger framework of twentieth-century European history.

Provides a critical examination of the history of labor and working people in the Americas, from the colonial era to the present. It focuses on the experience of the United States and Mexico, offering a comparative perspective on their distinct but also shared (and increasingly linked) histories. The seminar proceeds chronologically, highlighting major episodes in the evolution of labor systems in the two countries, beginning with the colonial labor systems implemented by the Spanish and British empires following the European conquest of the Western Hemisphere. Among other topics, we will examine the pivotal role of slavery and other forms of forced labor, the impact of the industrial revolution, the emergence and expansion of corporate capitalism and the labor unrest it provoked in the post-civil war U.S., the role of labor in the Mexican Revolution and its aftermath, the impact of the Great Depression and labor incorporation on the post-WWII social and political order of both countries, the breakdown of that order and the move to neo-liberalism in the 1970s and 1980s, and the emergence of an increasingly integrated North American production system and its consequences for labor and working people on both sides of the US-Mexico border.

Probes the exciting twists and turns of revolutionary politics and the attempt to spread ""liberty  equality"" into ordinary life, even abolishing slavery in response to massive slave revolt in the French colonies. Asks how the French interacted with a transnational revolutionary movement across Europe, the US, and the Atlantic world. Though focused on a specific revolutionary era, the course also aims to reflect on timeless questions: Why is it so difficult to create democracy? Is violence ever justified to overcome oppression and injustice? Finally, why did this experiment in radical democracy also unleash the Terror and launch Napoleon Bonaparte, the politician and general who built an astonishing European Empire?

This course is intended to help students understand World War II from the perspective of Asia. The focus is not only on the American and Japanese roles in the war but also on lesser, often overlooked participants such as China, Korea, and Southeast Asia. The course will focus not only on the diplomatic, political, and military situation of wartime Asia, but also on perceptions and experiences of the war from those most heavily affected by it: those experiencing it on the ground. Understanding this war is critical for helping us understand contemporary Asia. The foundations of the Cold War and the post-Cold War world that we live in today were forged on battlefields in mainland China, Burma, small islands in the Pacific, and in the skies over the archipelago of Japan. In order to provide the background and understand the legacies, this course covers an extended time frame, beginning in the 19th century with the arrival of the West in Asia and continues into the 1950s.

How powerful is non-military power? What are its vectors and its limits? International relations theorists have defined soft power as ""the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion."" This graduate seminar will put this notion to the test. We will investigate how elites, interest groups, religious bodies, and nation-states seek to exercise hegemony in the international order through non-violent means. How was ""soft power"" implemented on the ground in the 20th century- and how did its use transform international relations? To probe these questions, we will focus on a series of case studies in European and U.S. international history. Topics covered include the expansion of capitalism and consumer culture; the globalization of international legal instruments and human rights claims; and de-secularization, religious radicalism, and counter-insurgency. In the process of analyzing our case studies, we will refine our analytical vocabulary. Drawing on recent work in international relations, political theory, and international history, we will probe the meaning and utility of concepts like normative power, hegemony, cultural capital, and public diplomacy.

The course then turns to empirical themes in Latin American revolutions, challenging students to use and question the theoretical tools to which they have already been exposed.

Offers a general primer on large-scale policies directed by US federal and state governments, with specific examples in pressing policy areas. The class does not intend to do certain things, such as consider rationales for government intervention, or explain different stages of the policy process. Other classes in political science and economics perform such tasks well. Instead, it takes existing policies and the policy process as a given, explains them in detail, and puts a policy focus on very specific contemporary questions of concern to policymakers. A student of this class will gain a broad overall knowledge of how the majority of state and federal funding is spent and the policy outcomes associated with that spending. Enroll Info: None

Leadership is one of the most important but perplexing topics in the public sector; almost all agree its important, but we often disagree about what it actually means, or how to study it. This course aims to demystify the role of leadership in a public setting. We will draw on research from public management, psychology and organization studies to help students how leadership manifests itself in the public sector. This means understanding how to set goals, the motivation of those around you, how to engage and negotiate with stakeholders, managing change, making decisions, and exhibiting ethical behavior. The class will mix research with practical examples. The class starts with the assumption that while there are some general traits relevant across public, private and non-profit sectors, the nature of these sectors is different, and this affects how these traits function in practice.

How powerful is non-military power? What are its vectors and its limits? International relations theorists have defined soft power as ""the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion."" This graduate seminar will put this notion to the test. We will investigate how elites, interest groups, religious bodies, and nation-states seek to exercise hegemony in the international order through non-violent means. How was ""soft power"" implemented on the ground in the 20th century- and how did its use transform international relations? To probe these questions, we will focus on a series of case studies in European and U.S. international history. Topics covered include the expansion of capitalism and consumer culture; the globalization of international legal instruments and human rights claims; and de-secularization, religious radicalism, and counter-insurgency. In the process of analyzing our case studies, we will refine our analytical vocabulary. Drawing on recent work in international relations, political theory, and international history, we will probe the meaning and utility of concepts like normative power, hegemony, cultural capital, and public diplomacy.

Focuses on ethical issues implicated in a population-level approach to disease prevention and health promotion.  Explores prominent theoretical approaches to public health ethics and engages with several ethical tensions.  Issues discussed can include:  the use of coercive or intrusive public health interventions that restrict individual freedom, infringe upon individual privacy, and/or invite individual harm (or risks of harm); the justification of patemalistic measures in societies or sub-populations that seemingly indulge in pleasurable yet unhealthy behaviors; the extent to which societies should hold individuals responsible for their health conditions; the need to decide who receives life-saving treatment or vaccination when not all can; the need to choose between the identifiable victims we can save with expensive measures here and now and the more numerous unidentifiable victims we could save in the future with the same monetary investment; the trade-offs between maximizing aggregate health benefits and addressing the special needs of vulnerable social sub-groups and individuals; climate changes and intergenerational justice; ethical issues in international pharmaceutical research, and the need to establish reasonable limits to public health demands in a world where health outcomes are profoundly influenced by policies in other domains (such as transportation, housing, unemployment, and education) that generate their own ethical problems and imperatives.

",3,THE MEDICAL HISTORY OF SEX AND SEXUALITY
Declared in the Health and the Humanities certificate,MED HIST/​ENGL/​HIST SCI  525,"
Explores how a humanistic perspective can broaden our understanding of health and medicine. Specifically, we will examine the role of language and culture in the creation and circulation of biomedical knowledge; our lived experiences with illness (physical and mental); the intricate intersections of race, gender, sexuality, disability and medicine; the political dimensions of diagnosis, disease, and epidemics, and the role that fiction, creative non-fiction, comics, and film play in shaping our experiences with health and medicine as health care providers and as patients. The course does not assume any background in science or medicine. One of our recurrent topics, in fact, will be to consider how non-experts interact with medicine and its technical vocabularies. Although the primary objective of the course is to understand the cultural, social, and political dimensions of health and medicine, a secondary objective is for students to become more savvy patients and, for the few students who might emerge on the other side of the stethoscope one day, more well rounded health care professionals.

Narrative medicine is the practice of using stories to understand health and illness in the context of people's lives. Whether through fiction or nonfiction, poetry or prose, text or graphics, giving voice to the stories of patients and caregivers allows their experiences to be heard, made sense of, and valued. Learning to listen to others and to express one's own vulnerabilities are valuable tools for all health practitioners, but they are especially valuable in the context of public health. The scope of public health interventions encourages practitioners to think in terms of populations, but efforts to improve quality of life through prevention must ultimately be grounded in individual lives. Explore how narrative medicine techniques can enrich the practice of public health, both through the power of listening to stories to understand how individuals experience health and through the power of telling stories to mobilize communities.

This course provides an overview of the field of environmental health, using a systems thinking approach. Systems thinking recognizes that environmental health problem solving is complex and that solutions in one area may have positive or negative impacts on other areas. As an overview it provides an introduction to the history of environmental health within the field of public health from the local to the federal and global level. It will introduce multiple disciplines, methods and approaches to numerous environmental health topics. It includes introduction to methods and tools necessary for assessing human health risks from a variety of environmental hazards and exposures found in air, land, and water with a focus on physical and chemical risks. Additional details regarding specific hazard, exposure and health outcome data and their relationship to environmental health risk assessment, environmental health decision-making and management form a public health practice perspective will be discussed. Students will become familiar with the practice of environmental health lectures and case studies. A primary goal of this course is to address core environmental health competencies for Masters of Public Health students. In addition, this course is designed to help students think critically about complex problems and practice effective communication both in written as well as oral forms of communication. As such, it will provide an overview of fundamental information and tools that public health practitioners will need to know how to use. It will also lay the foundation for more high-level courses in the field of environmental health for those wishing to pursue aspects of this field in more detail. It is aimed at students with a diverse knowledge set and background coming into the course, a general sense of basic biology and chemistry will be helpful, but not necessary. Enroll Info: None

This course will deepen our understanding of how health is produced over the life course. A life course approach focuses on how early life experiences influence health across lives and possibly generations. This includes the concept of ""linked lives"" or how health is produced in the context of familial and social relationships. Using a life course and human development framework, we will explore a number of concepts explaining how exposures in early life lead to health outcomes at later life stages. Namely, we will examine critical or sensitive periods (i.e., ""Barker hypothesis"" or ""fetal or biological programming""), cumulative effects, pathways and trajectories, risk and resilience, and  intergenerational impacts (transmission of health across one or more  generations). Through this lens, we will consider the biobehavioral processes that underlie the development of health across the life course. Together this  theoretical and empirical evidence will be applied to the understanding of the evolution and persistence of health disparities. Data sources, study designs,  and statistical approaches used in life course epidemiology and family health services research will also be reviewed and evaluated. Finally, we will explore implications for clinical and public health practice, policy, and health system development with an eye towards the development of effective and sustainable life course interventions. We will conclude the course with an in-depth examination of three case-studies that will allow the students to apply their knowledge to specific life course and family health services research examples. The purpose of this course is to provide students with a foundation for understanding: 1) the terminology and theoretical framework used in life  course epidemiology and family health services research; 2) biobehavioral pathways by which early life experiences impact health across the life course; 3) the data sources, study designs, and statistical approaches used in life course epidemiology and family health services research; 4) the implications for clinical and public health practice, policy, and health system development with an eye towards the development of effective and sustainable life course interventions.

Explores the relationships and interactions between religion and politics from a comparative perspective. The course will discuss the appropriate relationship between religion and state. In the first part of the course students will investigate the implications of the various ways in which the religion-state relationship have been involved in political conflict. Building on this, the course will then turn to several of the current issues in religion and politics asking: Why is religion apparently more important than ever despite an increasingly secular world? What is religious nationalism? What is fundamentalism? How can we explain the similarities and differences between religious fundamentalist movements across the globe? How should democratic states cope with the emergence of fundamentalist movements? In order to begin answering these questions, the course will integrate the theoretical frameworks we develop with explorations of the historical and local context of relevant case-studies from around the world.

Looking at the cultural institutions of politics, medicine, and religion in multiple cultures and historical times, students will explore ideas about what constitutes a perfect body, how and why different parts of the body are privileged over others, and how and why the notion of bodily perfectibility differs for men and women, children and adults, and humans and gods. Readings encourage such questions as: Is the perfect body attainable and, if so, how? And, who benefits from bodily perfection (or the rhetoric of the bodily perfection)? We will ask these questions with comparative intent: we want both to learn about cultures other than our own and, in the process of understanding the other, we will ask how this new knowledge might empower us to be more observant and critical of the role(s) and treatment of the body in our own society historically and today.

The public policy process is structured argument and decision making within institutional contexts. This class introduces students to analytic frameworks for thinking about various aspects of this process. We do not study a single context or policy, but, rather, seek to understand how policies might succeed (or fail) in one context or another. The principal framework is institutional analysis, or the way in which formal and informal rules shape policies and their outcomes. Students will learn to perform institutional analysis as well as write a memorandum presenting such an analysis to a policymaker. Students will align their final projects to their personal and professional activities and/or their internship. The course will help students understand how policies can achieve durable impact, and how progress made through policies can be defended amid institutional pitfalls. Enroll Info: None

",3,INTERNATIONAL SECURITY
Graduate/professional standing,POLISCI/​HISTORY/​PUB AFFR  724,"
How powerful is non-military power? What are its vectors and its limits? International relations theorists have defined soft power as ""the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion."" This graduate seminar will put this notion to the test. We will investigate how elites, interest groups, religious bodies, and nation-states seek to exercise hegemony in the international order through non-violent means. How was ""soft power"" implemented on the ground in the 20th century- and how did its use transform international relations? To probe these questions, we will focus on a series of case studies in European and U.S. international history. Topics covered include the expansion of capitalism and consumer culture; the globalization of international legal instruments and human rights claims; and de-secularization, religious radicalism, and counter-insurgency. In the process of analyzing our case studies, we will refine our analytical vocabulary. Drawing on recent work in international relations, political theory, and international history, we will probe the meaning and utility of concepts like normative power, hegemony, cultural capital, and public diplomacy.
